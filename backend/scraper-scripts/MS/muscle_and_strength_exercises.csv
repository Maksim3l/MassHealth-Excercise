It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body.If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area.

Barbell Bench Press Video Exercise Guide,Chest,"Shoulders, Triceps","Shoulders, Triceps","Shoulders, Triceps","The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body.By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way.Some of these variations include:Incline bench pressDecline bench press,Dumbbell bench pressDumbbell incline bench pressDumbbell decline bench pressSmith machine bench pressThose with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.","Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat in order to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.If you want to learn more about about the intricacies of benching,Dave Tate’s benching bibleis a great place to start.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuwHzzPdaGc?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/barbell-bench-press.html

Decline Bench Press Video Exercise Guide,Chest,"Shoulders, Triceps","Shoulders, Triceps","Shoulders, Triceps","The decline bench press is a variation of thebench pressand an exercise used to target the muscles of the chest. It will also indirectly target the muscles of the shoulders and triceps.The decline bench press is commonly used to target the lower portion of the pecs. However, some argue that it is the most effective bench press variation for targeting the entire chest.Bench press variations can be included in yourchest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, andfull body workouts.","Lie flat on an decline bench, set your hands just outside of shoulder width, and hook your feet underneath the pad.Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.Lower the bar in a straight line to just below your sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench and extending the elbows.Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIgci8aNsG0?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/decline-bench-press.html

Here’s some factors to consider:If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise.

It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes.The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core.The conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in everyworkout program.For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there.Some of these deadlift variations include:Trap Bar DeadliftRomanian DeadliftStiff Leg DeadliftLandmine DeadliftDumbbell DeadliftSmith Machine DeadliftGrip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.","Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjsu6ceEkAQ?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/deadlifts.html

Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts.

Trap Bar Deadlift Video Exercise Guide,Hamstrings,"Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back","Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back","Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back","The trap bar deadlift is a variation of thedeadliftand an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the hamstrings. It will also indirectly target the other muscles of the leg, as well as the lats, forearms, traps, and lower back.The trap bar deadlift is often seen as a quad dominant variation of the deadlift, and while it does incorporate the quads to a larger degree than some other deadlift variations, it still is a hip hinge movement. And hip hinges should be primarily felt through the hamstrings and glutes.The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.The trap bar deadlift is best utilized during yourleg workoutsand/orfull body workouts.","Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance.Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width.Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Stance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow.

That’s where utilizing the band assisted Nordic hamstring curl can help by allowing one to train the movement pattern while assisting in the most difficult portions of the exercise.","Loop a band around the upper portion of a lat pull down machine.Set your feet underneath the knee pad and grab onto the band behind your head with both hands.Keeping your hips extended, slowly lower yourself to a parallel position with the floor.Flex your hamstrings and pull yourself back to the starting position while keeping your torso in a straight line.Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","If have access to an actual nordic hamstring curl machine that would be ideal. If not, try to utilize a lat pulldown machine as that is the easiest option to adapt for setup. If neither option is available, consider the partner assisted version. If you don’t have access to anyone who can hold your ankles in place, consider a setup with a power rack whereby your ankles are positioned underneath the squat pad on a weighted barbell and you have a pad underneath your knees.You can also wrap the band around your chest if you prefer a hands free version. However, if you grab the band behind the head you can modify where your hands are placed, thus allowing yourself more or less assistance as needed.Ideally you should look to keep your hips extended throughout the duration of the set, don’t allow them to shoot back and take tension off of your hamstrings.Remember, bands return what is requested - the more you stretch them, the more they assist you. If you need more, simply grip higher on the band.When extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back. If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/SI8bdn_mpqQ?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/band-assisted-nordic-hamstring-curl

Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically.The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.You should keep the handle of the kettlebell directly over the midfoot at the start of every repetition.Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up.

The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body.These slight changes seen in the trap bar Romanian deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.,Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance.Assume a neutral grip on the handles and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.Begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.,"Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the range of motion to control that much range of motion effectively.It may be easier to utilize the trap bar given the load is distributed on both sides of the body rather than in front.

Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.Take a few steps back and stabilize yourself. You are now in the starting position.Step forward with your left leg while maintaining your balance and squat down through your hips. Keep your torso straight and head up. Don't allow your knee to track out over your toes.From this squatting position, push through the balls of you feet to jump a few inches from the ground.Immediately return to the squatting position and repeat for desired reps.Then repeat the movement with your right foot forward.​Exercise Tips:Never allow your knees to track out over your toes during this movement. Doing so will place undue stress on the knee joints.This exercise requires a good deal of balance and is not recommended for those with balance issues. Practice the movement with little to no weight when first starting out.Keep your head up and back straight throughout the exercise. Never allow your back to round.There is no need to jump high when performing this exercise. A an inch or so off the ground will suffice. Focus on landing softly back onto your toes while lowering yourself in a controlled manner.Use caution when performing this exercise if you have had any previous back or knee problems.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.Given the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant.The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up.

Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCuawmNbo4E?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/snatch-grip-deadlift
One-Leg Lying Cable Hamstring Curl Video Exercise Guide,Hamstrings,None,None,None,,"Set up for the one-leg lying cable hamstring curl by elevating a flat bench on a block or step grabbing a decline bench.

Single Leg Landmine Romanian Deadlift Video Exercise Guide,Hamstrings,"Abs, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Traps, Upper Back","Abs, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Traps, Upper Back","Abs, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Traps, Upper Back",The landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a variation of theRomanian deadliftand an exercise used to target the entire posterior chain.One of the main difference between the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift and other Romanian deadlift variation is the use of the landmine implement. Use of the landmine provides a fix plane of motion for the lifter to complete the exercise in. It also challenges the grip strength of the lifter who now must grasp the thickest portion of the barbell.The other difference is the fact that the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a unilateral exercise. This allows you to target each side of the body at a time to build a more aesthetic physique as well as balanced strength.,"Stand perpendicular to a barbell in a landmine attachment.Grasp the end of the bar with one hand and stand tall.Begin the RDL by lifting one foot, unlocking your knee, and slowly hinging back into your hip.Push through the floor and extend the hip as you return to the starting position.Reset and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Focus on pushing your heel back as far as possible and hinging into the hip rather than dropping your chest.Don’t allow the hips to rotate, you should be able to balance a cup of water on your back in the bottom of the movement.Your chin should follow your chest, don’t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement.Ideally you should keep a straight line from your head through your heel.Keep a soft bend in your knee and don’t allow your arch to collapse as you complete the movement.Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.Don’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.To learn and master single RDLs, it may be conducive to utilize assisted versions by lightly holding onto a rack with your free hand or hinging with both legs in position like a normal RDL but keep one foot hovering off the floor.If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.If you find one glute has less contractility than another, perform the movement unilaterally and then incorporate the bilateral version after you have accumulated sufficient volume on the side with poor contractility.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/ig0CXKolalM?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/single-leg-landmine-romanian-deadlift
Dumbbell Stiff Leg Deadlift (On Bench) Video Exercise Guide,Hamstrings,"Glutes, Lower Back","Glutes, Lower Back","Glutes, Lower Back",,"Performing the dumbbell stiff leg deadlift on a bench allows for a greater range of motion.Begin by placing two flat benches together side by side. Space them apart so that when you stand on them, your feet will be around shoulder-width apart.Choose a pair of dumbbells and stand securely with one foot on each bench and a slight bend in your knees. Hold the dumbbells down at our side. You are now in the starting position.Keep your back as straight as possible and bend over at the waist lowering the dumbbells over the tops of your feet. Your knees should be kept stationary during the movement.Focus on the stretch in your hamstrings, and continue to lower the dumbbells down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably.Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the dumbbells straight back up.Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding.Squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up.Repeat for desired reps.","You must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round.The dumbbells need to stay close to your body throughout the set. The further the dumbbells are from your body the more strain is on your lower back.Focus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the dumbbells and contracting them as you raise back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise.It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set).During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back, and abdominal tight as you begin the ascent.Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back.Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight and practice the movement.

From there one can progress to more advanced hip hinges such as thedeadlift.","Assume a hinged position with your knees slightly bent, one hand on the kettlebell handle, chin tucked, and weight centered over your foot. Utilize your free hand to help assist with balance.Begin the movement by hiking the kettlebell between your legs and keeping your spine neutral.Drive the kettlebell back to the starting position by extending the hips, pushing through the floor, and keeping the arms straight.Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.","The swing should be a fairly explosive and snappy movement, the point is to generate hip extension as rapidly as possible followed by a subsequent contraction.Imagine you’re trying to hike a football between your legs as the kettlebell descends.Your weight will obviously shift to your heels during the bottom portion of the exercise but you shouldn’t allow the toes to rise.Your chin should follow your chest, don’t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement.Keep a soft bend in your knees and don’t allow your arches to collapse as you complete the movement.Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/uY3sOWqDYsc?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/one-arm-kettlebell-swing
Hamstring Tiger Tail Video Exercise Guide,Hamstrings,None,None,None,"The tiger tail is an implement used to perform a form of self myo-fascial release.Using the tiger tail on the hamstrings is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout, especially if you plan to perform lower body exercises that require the hamstrings to be more mobile.When you perform SMR on your hamstrings, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.","While in a seated position, position the tiger tail on the underside of the thigh with one hand on either handle.Adjust pressure into hamstrings by applying more or less force through the hands.Slowly roll up and down the length of one side of the thigh for 20-30 seconds.Repeat on the other side.","Given that there are hamstrings located on both the medial and lateral aspects of the thigh, you may need to tilt the roller slightly to target one group (medial/lateral) more than the other.Since the hamstrings cross the knee and the hip, experiment with rolling them out while keeping the knee bent or straight.The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.In addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.Foam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/25a-2bOnhvk?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/hamstring-tiger-tail
Paused Sumo Deadlift Video Exercise Guide,Hamstrings,"Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back","Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back","Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back","The paused sumo deadlift is a variation of thesumo deadliftand an exercise used to build and strengthen the muscles of the leg and posterior chain.Adding pauses, as seen in the paused sumo deadlift, is an effective intensity technique used to strengthen the target muscle groups. The pause increases the time under tension of the targeted muscle groups and forces the lifter to really be able to control the weight they are using.","Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a very wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.Pause for a 2 count as soon as the plates break the floor.Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","The length and location of the pause will vary based upon your sticking point and what you’re trying to accomplish by utilizing the lift.Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_fslq_Fvb0?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/paused-sumo-deadlift

Neck Tiger Tail Video Exercise Guide,Neck,None,None,None,"The tiger tail is an implement used to perform a form of self myo-fascial release.Using the tiger tail on the neck is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout.When you perform SMR on your neck, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.","While in a seated position, position the tiger tail at the base of the neck with one hand on either handle.Adjust pressure into neck by applying more or less force through the hands.Slowly roll up and down the length of one side of the neck for 20-30 seconds.Repeat on the other side.","The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.In addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.Foam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8hJmUXlogA?rel=0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/neck-tiger-tail
