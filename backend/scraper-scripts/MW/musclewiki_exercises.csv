Barbell Curl,Biceps,Barbell,Intermediate,"While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. | Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. | Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard. | Slowly bring the weight back down to the starting position.","- Grab the barbell with a shoulder width, underhand grip. | - Flex at the elbows until your forearms press into your bicep (this will look different from person to person). | - Begin to extend your elbows and control the weight during the eccentric part of the exercise. | - Make sure to fully extend your elbows at the end of the rep. | - Repeat until you hit muscular fatigue (1-3 reps left in the tank)","One of the drawbacks with a Barbell Curl is the bar limits Range of Motion somewhat. The bar will hit your legs before you can fully extend your arms. On most exercises, we want the longest Range or Motion possible. To remedy this, | Push your butt back a tad bit. This will give you a little more room to fully extend your elbows. | Watch out for cheating. Using momentum often naturally happens with a Barbell Curl (and most Dumbbell curl variations). There is a move called the Cheat Curl popularized by Arnold himself. But consider that a separate exercise. | Root your feet to the floor and use a mirror to watch your form. If your hips begin moving and you're unable to continue to perform reps without any hip movement, end the set. | A 6-12 rep range works well for this exercise.",https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Barbell-barbell-curl-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Barbell-barbell-curl-side.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/barbell/male/biceps/barbell-curl
Barbell Bench Press,Chest,Barbell,Intermediate,Lay flat on the bench with your feet on the ground. With straight arms unrack the bar. | Lower the bar to your mid chest | Raise the bar until you've locked your elbows.,,"Don't be hesitant to ask for a spot if you don't have a gym partner. Most people are happy to help. There's research showing that a lifter will perform better with a spotter. Your muscles won't be any stronger with or without a spotter of course. So why the improvement in performance? The confidence alluded to in the how-to section. Knowing someone is there to get the bar if you fail provides the security to allow you to lift with confidence. | Just make sure you communicate before starting the set. | First, ask them to give you a lift off. I've had many ask me for a spot then say they don't want a lift off. Never quite understood why. In many cases (unless you have very long arms), you will lose your shoulder blade retraction when trying to un-rack the bar. If your arms are mostly extended the only choice you have to un-rack is to protract your shoulder blades. The further you can get your shoulder blades pulled back the better. Retracting the shoulder blades also gives more room in the shoulder joint so it is generally a safer position. | Also, let the spotter know how many reps you're going for so they know what to expect and don't jump in too early. Let them know whether or not you want help completing any reps. For example, ""I'm going for 10 reps, but I might fail around 8. If I can't get all the reps by myself, can you help me get the remaining ones?"" | Although, I suggest once you hit muscular fatigue, you end your set. Once a muscle hits fatigue, doing additional reps does not induce more muscle growth, but does fatigue you more. Too much risk, not enough reward.",https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-barbell-bench-press-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-barbell-bench-press-side_KciuhbB.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/barbell/male/chest/barbell-bench-press

Barbell Deadlift,"Traps (mid-back), Lower back, Glutes",Barbell,Intermediate,"Stand with your mid-foot under the bar and grip the bar with your hands, about a shoulder width apart. | Bend your knees, then lift the bar by straightening your back. It is important to keep your back straight. | Stand to your full height and hold. | Lower the bar to the floor by bending your knees and keeping your back straight.","#1. Your stance | Conventional Deadlift Foot Placement: You can start with your feet shoulder-width apart. If you’re not sure where this is, try this: Jump in the air 2-3 times. Where your feet land naturally is the proper stance for the conventional deadlift. Your toes should point forward or outward slightly. | Set up so that the bar is about an inch to an inch-and-a-half from your shins. When you look down at the bar, it should be positioned right about the middle of your foot, blocking the laces of your shoes from view. | #2. Your grip | Figuring out where to place your hands is quite simple. Just take a shoulder-width grip. | Executing the Deadlift | You really only need to think about two things when you pull the bar: | During a conventional deadlift, if you are thinking about “pushing the floor away,” it will help you generate tension throughout your hips and knees. | Keeping your core, arms, and lats engaged will help you avoid rounding your spine, which is dangerous. DO NOT ROUND YOUR SPINE. | When you reach the top of the rep, known as lockout, be careful | Some people seem to think that “locking out” means “leaning back,” but nothing could be further from the truth. Doing that hyperextends your knees and spine, which can compress those all-important spinal discs between your vertebrae. DO NOT HYPEREXTEND YOUR SPINE. | The goal, really, is to just stand up.","My Deadlift, Not Yours | The deadlift involves many muscles, all of your limbs, and every load-bearing joint (ankles, knees, hips and shoulders) in your body. There are a lot of variables at play. So having hard-and-fast rules about deadlift form is nearly impossible. | Your body is your body. That seems like an obvious fact, yet it’s one that’s often overlooked when it comes to form. | For example, two people who are the same height may have totally different torso and femur lengths. | A person who has a short torso and long femurs will have a more hip-dominant pull, meaning that their butt will be higher in the air and most of the force will come from their glutes and hamstrings. Meanwhile, a person who has a long torso and short femurs would be able to get lower and involve their quads a bit more.",https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Barbell-barbell-deadlift-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Barbell-barbell-deadlift-side.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/barbell/male/traps-middle/barbell-deadlift

Dumbbell Seated Overhead Press,"Shoulders, Front Shoulders",Dumbbells,Novice,Sit on a bench with back support. Raise the dumbbells to shoulder height with your palms forward. | Raise the dumbbells upwards and pause at the contracted position. | Lower the weights back to starting position.,"Setup | Grab two dumbbells and set up on an incline or seated bench. Make sure your back is pressed all the way into the vertical pad. | Flare your elbows out. Your face should be facing the ceiling and your palms facing forward. Also, make sure the dumbbell is set very deeply in your hand so your wrist stays in a strong position for the entire set. | Performing | Press the dumbbells up toward the ceiling, fully extending your elbows. Do not hyperextend or lockout your elbows as this is dangerous for those joints. The dumbbells should travel in an arc-like curve. With the dumbbells converging at the top of the ramp. There's no need to touch the dumbbells together at the top, but there's nothing wrong if they do. | After extending your elbows, begin the eccentric portion of the rep. Make sure your upper arm at least reaches parallel with the ground before initiating the next concentric. If you have the shoulder mobility, you can go all the way to the point the dumbbells tap your shoulders. This may give people with shoulder issues some pain. If it does, cut the range of motion a little shorter. | Make sure your back stays flat against the vertical pad for the entire set. There is a tendency to begin extending the spine when fatiguing on an overhead press. Your nervous system understands that you are stronger pushing horizontally than you are pushing vertically. And so it will begin to point your chest up toward the ceiling to try to involve your pecs. Don't let this happen. A hyperextended spine with a weight pushing straight down from overhead will place a lot of unneeded stress on your lumbar spine. | ©2025 MuscleWiki SEZC Some rights reserved. | ©2025 MuscleWiki SEZC Some rights reserved.. | ©2025 MuscleWiki SEZC Some rights reserved.",,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-dumbbell-seated-overhead-press-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-dumbbell-seated-overhead-press-side.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/dumbbells/male/shoulders/dumbbell-seated-overhead-press

Rotate at the spine bringing the dumbbell from your right quadricep up to roughly eye level on your left side. Keep your elbows mostly extended. Do not rotate too far.

Dumbbell Shrug,Traps,Dumbbells,Novice,Stand tall with two dumbbells. Pull your shoulder blades up. Give a one second squeeze at the top.,"Setup | Grab two dumbbells and stand tall with a narrow foot stance. Poke your chest out and pull your shoulder blades back. The dumbbells should be on the side of your legs. | Performing | Pull your shoulder joint straight up toward the ceiling. Get your shoulders as high as you can. You should feel your traps contract very hard when you have hit an adequate range of motion. From this point, begin to drop your shoulders back down to the starting position. | Avoid rolling your shoulders. This is a very common form mistake on shrugs. The upper portion of the traps elevates the scapula, while the mid and lower traps, retract and depress the scapula. However, when you are in a seated or standing position the dumbbells will be pulling downward (because of gravity) so scapular elevation is the only anatomical function being performed against resistance. Therefore, retracting and depressing the scapula on each rep (rolling the shoulders) will not recruit your mid and lower traps. You would need a different exercise for that. | Also, pay particular attention to your neck. It is also very common to push one's head forward when performing a shrug. This can put unnecessary stress on your neck and cervical spine. Keep your chin pulled back and your head in a neutral position.",,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Dumbbells-dumbbell-shrug-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Dumbbells-dumbbell-shrug-side.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/dumbbells/male/traps/dumbbell-shrug

Pull Ups,"Traps (mid-back), Lats",Bodyweight,Intermediate,"Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, arms and shoulders fully extended. | Pull your body up until your chin is above the bar. | Lower your body back to starting position.","Setup | Grab the Pull Up bar with an overhand grip. If you get wrist pain from gripping a Pull Up bar, try using a thumbless grip. It won't affect your grip strength too much, but will give your wrists a little more room to move. Also, make sure the bars are set very deeply in your hand. Your palms should be making contact with the bar. | Next, if you are using a bench or box to reach the Pull Up bars, step off of the step, and hold for a second, in a dead hang position. If you begin initiating the Pull Up before the dead hang, you might swing too much to perform a proper strict Pull Up. If you can reach the Pull Up bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening. | Pull your shoulder blades down. This will engage your mid and lower traps and force your lats to do most of the work. Also, before beginning the first rep, make sure your elbows are extended. | Lower body | Angle your legs forward slightly, push your hips back, and point your toes. This will force you to flex your abdominals and keep you more stable throughout the rep. (This will massively help you keep the reps strict). | Performing | Once you are in the proper position, begin to pull. Imagine trying to pull your elbows not just down, but inward toward your spine. This cue will help you engage one of the lats’ more overlooked functions, vertical adduction. | Get your chin over the bar before beginning the eccentric portion of the rap. Your elbows should fully extend at the bottom of each rep. | Step by Step Progression | Decide on a rep range. For example, 6 to 10. Once you are able to perform 10 reps with strict form, then it is time to progress. Do not be shy or hesitant to start adding weight to your Pull Up early on. Even if it is only 5 pounds. Progress is progress! From there, progress the Pull Up, like it would any other exercise. Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight. | The best way to get better at doing Pull Ups is to do Pull Ups. But if you can't do them in the first place, then what should you do?",,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-bodyweight-pullup-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-bodyweight-pullup-side.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/bodyweight/male/traps-middle/pull-ups

Cable Rope Pushdown,Triceps,Cables,Novice,The cable should be set all the way at the top of the machine. | Make sure to keep your upper arm glued at your side. Extend your elbows until you feel your triceps contract.,"Set Up | Grab onto the rope and take a few steps back. You can start with your elbows in an extended or flexed position. | Push your butt back slightly. This will get your hips out of the way giving your arms enough room to fully extend. | Performing The Cable Pushdown | My favorite cue to use on the Tricep Push Down is, ""T-Rex arms."" It's extremely important that you keep your upper arm and your elbows glued to your side. Your elbow joint should be causing the movement and your forearm should be the only moving body part. This will keep the stress and tension purely on your triceps and not recruit other body parts. Make sure to fully extend and flex your elbows on each rep. | Be careful of swinging and bouncing on this exercise. It is very common to use too much weight on this exercise. If you find yourself having to use momentum, the weight is too heavy. | Also, if you notice your shoulders beginning to roll forward on the concentric, the weight is too heavy. Your central nervous system is extremely intelligent and will help you get from point A to point B by any means necessary. It will begin trying to recruit your anterior deltoid and pec major by rolling your shoulders forward on top of the rope or straight bar so you can press the weight down instead of performing a strict Triceps Extension.",,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Cables-cable-push-down-side.mp4#t=0.1,https://media.musclewiki.com/media/uploads/videos/branded/male-Cables-cable-push-down-front.mp4#t=0.1,https://musclewiki.com/cables/male/triceps/cable-rope-pushdown
