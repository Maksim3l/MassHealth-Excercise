            "Don't be hesitant to ask for a spot if you don't have a gym partner. Most people are happy to help. There's research showing that a lifter will perform better with a spotter. Your muscles won't be any stronger with or without a spotter of course. So why the improvement in performance? The confidence alluded to in the how-to section. Knowing someone is there to get the bar if you fail provides the security to allow you to lift with confidence.",
            "Just make sure you communicate before starting the set.",
            "First, ask them to give you a lift off. I've had many ask me for a spot then say they don't want a lift off. Never quite understood why. In many cases (unless you have very long arms), you will lose your shoulder blade retraction when trying to un-rack the bar. If your arms are mostly extended the only choice you have to un-rack is to protract your shoulder blades. The further you can get your shoulder blades pulled back the better. Retracting the shoulder blades also gives more room in the shoulder joint so it is generally a safer position.",
            "Also, let the spotter know how many reps you're going for so they know what to expect and don't jump in too early. Let them know whether or not you want help completing any reps. For example, \"I'm going for 10 reps, but I might fail around 8. If I can't get all the reps by myself, can you help me get the remaining ones?\"",
            "Although, I suggest once you hit muscular fatigue, you end your set. Once a muscle hits fatigue, doing additional reps does not induce more muscle growth, but does fatigue you more. Too much risk, not enough reward."

Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.",

There's no need to touch the dumbbells together at the top, but there's nothing wrong if they do.",
            "After extending your elbows, begin the eccentric portion of the rep. Make sure your upper arm at least reaches parallel with the ground before initiating the next concentric. If you have the shoulder mobility, you can go all the way to the point the dumbbells tap your shoulders. This may give people with shoulder issues some pain. If it does, cut the range of motion a little shorter.",
            "Make sure your back stays flat against the vertical pad for the entire set. There is a tendency to begin extending the spine when fatiguing on an overhead press. Your nervous system understands that you are stronger pushing horizontally than you are pushing vertically. And so it will begin to point your chest up toward the ceiling to try to involve your pecs. Don't let this happen. A hyperextended spine with a weight pushing straight down from overhead will place a lot of unneeded stress on your lumbar spine.",

The upper portion of the traps elevates the scapula, while the mid and lower traps, retract and depress the scapula. However, when you are in a seated or standing position the dumbbells will be pulling downward (because of gravity) so scapular elevation is the only anatomical function being performed against resistance. Therefore, retracting and depressing the scapula on each rep (rolling the shoulders) will not recruit your mid and lower traps. You would need a different exercise for that.",

If you can reach the Pull Up bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening.",

Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight.",

Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.

        "overview": "The Cable Crunch is an effective core exercise that targets the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis. Unlike floor crunches, the cable crunch reduces neck strain by allowing you to focus on using your abs without needing to lift your head or shoulders. It also helps improve spinal flexion, a fundamental movement for building a strong, functional core. This exercise helps strengthen and define the core, improve posture, and enhance overall abdominal endurance. Proper form is crucial to avoid strain on the lower back and ensure maximum activation of the ab muscles.",

However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout. The ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine. Some may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.",

The decline position requires greater activation of the abdominal muscles to lift the torso against gravity, helping to build strength and endurance in the core.",
        "instructions": [
            "Position yourself on a decline bench, securing your feet under the foot pads",
            "Lie back on the bench and position your arms over your chest or place them behind your head for support",
            "Exhale and squeeze your abs as you curl your upper body off the bench, bringing your chest toward your knees",
            "Pause at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your upper body back to the starting position",
            "This is one rep",
            "Perform the desired number of reps, maintaining proper form and control."

        "tips": [
            "Exhale as you lift your torso and inhale as you lower yourself back down",
            "If you want to engage the obliques, add a twisting motion to help improve posture, stability, and overall core function",
            "Perform the sit up slowly and with control, both while rising and lowering, to maximize muscle engagement and avoid using momentum",
            "Keep a neutral spine position throughout the movement; don\u2019t let your back arch too much as you lower yourself."

Dynamic stretching is critical prior to performing your workouts as it allows you to activate your central nervous system and engage the muscle groups you\u2019ll use later in your workout. Incorporating them into your warm up routine will help you get better results and avoid injury.",

By remaining seated during the seated dumbbell reverse curl, you eliminate the ability to arch your back and swing the weight up to the finishing position of the exercise. This provides a better isolation and contraction on the biceps. Performing curls utilizing a reverse grip, as seen in the seated dumbbell reverse curl, includes the forearms in the exercise to a far greater extent. And since you\u2019re likely able to curl more weight than you can wrist roll, you\u2019ll better stimulate the muscle fibers of the forearm to encourage more muscle growth.",

        "overview": "The single leg jump rope is a variation of the jump rope and a cardio exercise used to condition the entire body. Jumping rope in general requires and builds a lot of coordination, one of the most important components to human fitness. Unilateral exercises are excellent options for working one side of the body at a time to help build balanced strength and an aesthetic physique. Jump rope exercises, such as the single leg jump rope, are great calf building exercises as they provide a lot of repetition to the slow twitch muscle fibers of the calves and can be explosive by nature.",
        "instructions": [
            "Grasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope behind your heels",
            "Rotate the wrists to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body",
            "As the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one leg to allow it to pass underneath",
            "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions or time."
        ],
        "tips": [
            "Hopping on a single leg requires quite a bit of hip and ankle stability",
            "As such, if you encounter knee pain or you notice that your biomechanics are altered, consider utilizing a bilateral version and working to increase your single leg strength via training",
            "Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand",
            "Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially",
            "Don\u2019t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body",
            "Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses",
            "Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all",
            "When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits",
            "There\u2019s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet",
            "Conserve your energy for further jumps",
            "If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc)",
            "Don\u2019t forget to breath as you complete repetitions."

        "overview": "The reverse jump rope is a variation of the jump rope and a cardio exercise used to condition the entire body. Jumping rope in general requires and builds a lot of coordination, one of the most important components to human fitness. Jump rope exercises, such as the reverse jump rope, are great calf building exercises as they provide a lot of repetition to the slow twitch muscle fibers of the calves and can be explosive by nature.",
        "instructions": [
            "Grasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope in front of your toes",
            "Rotate the wrists backwards to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body",
            "As the rope moves toward your heels, jump with both feet to allow it to pass underneath",
            "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions or time."
        ],
        "tips": [
            "Be careful not to get into the habit of ducking or crouching as you jump as this will alter your mechanics",
            "If the rope is measured properly prior to jumping (see below for further instructions), then you won\u2019t have any contract issues provided the movement occurs primarily at the wrist",
            "Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand",
            "Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially",
            "Don\u2019t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body",
            "Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses",
            "Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all",
            "When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits",
            "There\u2019s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet",
            "Conserve your energy for further jumps",
            "If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc)",
            "Don\u2019t forget to breath as you complete repetitions."

            "In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb",
            "If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top",
            "Don\u2019t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits",
            "A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: \u201cFlare and push\u201d",
            "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back",
            "If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you\u2019re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury",
            "The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition",
            "If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands",
            "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path",
            "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or \u201csuicide\u201d grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first",
            "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling",
            "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip",
            "However, if you\u2019re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses",
            "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability",
            "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don\u2019t allow them to change position as you press",
            "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter\u2019s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum",
            "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you",
            "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift",
            "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back",
            "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to \u201cbend the bar\u201d in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder",
            "The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

One can better isolate certain muscle groups with a machine due to its fixed movement pattern. The machine incline bench press is best added towards the end of your chest workout if you are training for hypertrophy, after you\u2019ve used other more compound variations to work your push muscles.",

The neutral grip when pressing is popular among those with joint discomfort as it can put some of the major joints (shoulders, wrists, and elbows) in a more favorable pressing position. Incline variations of pressing are also popular as supplemental movements and accessory work for both athletes looking to increase their strength and improve their aesthetics. For instance, from an aesthetic standpoint, using an incline can help you better target the upper chest. And for those looking to improve their pressing numbers, the incline provides a challenge by altering the press to a more difficult and challenging angle.",
        "instructions": [
            "Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in)",
            "Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the edge of an incline bench",
            "To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest",
            "Once you are in position, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top using a neutral grip",
            "Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the handles should be about level with your chest)",
            "Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position while maintaining a neutral grip throughout the duration of the exercise",
            "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions",
            "**Dropping the dumbbells to the side is discouraged unless you are experienced with the technique or using excessively heavy weights",
            "**Ideally you should twist the dumbbells back to neutral (palms facing each other), bring your knees up so the ends of the dumbbells are touching your thighs, then use the weight of the dumbbells to rock back to an upright, seated position."

        "tips": [
            "Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely",

            "Don\u2019t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself",
            "Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as \u201cirradiation\u201d which promotes greater shoulder stability",

            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension",

        "overview": "The deadlift is an extremely popular exercise and a true test of total body strength. It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes. The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the \u201cbig three\u201d exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body). The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core. The conventional deadlift shouldn\u2019t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program. For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there. Some of these deadlift variations include: Trap Bar Deadlift Romanian Deadlift Stiff Leg Deadlift Landmine Deadlift Dumbbell Deadlift Smith Machine Deadlift Grip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.",
        "instructions": [
            "Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance",
            "Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor",
            "Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip",
            "Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion",
            "This phenomenon is commonly referred to as \u201cpulling the slack out of the bar\u201d",
            "As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you\u2019re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar",
            "Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away",
            "Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips",
            "Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward",
            "Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions."
        ],
        "tips": [
            "You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly",
            "The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat",
            "If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights",
            "In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion",
            "Use the cue: \u201csqueeze oranges in your armpits\u201d, \u201cput your shoulder blades in your back pockets\u201d (i.e",
            "scapular depression) or \u201cimagine you\u2019re doing a straight arm pulldown\u201d",
            "The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter\u2019s shirt before they pull (i.e",
            "\u201cchest up\u201d)",
            "The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats",
            "Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e",
            "keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up",
            "Here\u2019s some factors to consider: If you\u2019re someone who is more globally extended (i.e",
            "athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension",
            "Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics",
            "Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter\u2019s spine and limb length",
            "Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy",
            "Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you",
            "Do NOT retract your shoulder blades",
            "This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion",
            "Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don\u2019t utilize a false grip",
            "Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you\u2019re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar",
            "Scraping the shins isn\u2019t always necessary in the deadlift",
            "It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend",
            "To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won\u2019t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you\u2019ll be slow off the flow",
            "So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel",
            "Ensure the elbows stay locked out",
            "Don\u2019t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn\u2019t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights",
            "More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the \u201cpull the slack out the bar\u201d cue as much and that\u2019s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it\u2019s an important concept to understand and implement",
            "For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it\u2019s allowed and you\u2019re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors",
            "However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors",
            "The knees should be stacked over the feet",
            "If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies: The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width",
            "You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient",
            "If you find that you\u2019re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you\u2019re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts",
            "You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

A smart option, to increase training frequency and work on the movement pattern, would be to perform RDLs on your leg day and another deadlift variation on your back or pull days. The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it. The landmine implement provides a somewhat fixed movement pattern to take some of the stress of the stabilizing muscle groups to help emphasize hamstring usage and limit potential injuries from other variations.

This means, you\u2019re less likely to cheat as you would if trying to increase weight used in a weighted exercise. Instead, your goal should be to execute the exercise with perfect form before progressing to a more challenging single leg variation.",

        "overview": "The landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a variation of the Romanian deadlift and an exercise used to target the entire posterior chain. One of the main difference between the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift and other Romanian deadlift variation is the use of the landmine implement. Use of the landmine provides a fix plane of motion for the lifter to complete the exercise in. It also challenges the grip strength of the lifter who now must grasp the thickest portion of the barbell. The other difference is the fact that the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a unilateral exercise. This allows you to target each side of the body at a time to build a more aesthetic physique as well as balanced strength.",
        "instructions": [
            "Stand perpendicular to a barbell in a landmine attachment",

            "Focus on pushing your heel back as far as possible and hinging into the hip rather than dropping your chest",

            "Your chin should follow your chest, don\u2019t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement",
            "Ideally you should keep a straight line from your head through your heel",
            "Keep a soft bend in your knee and don\u2019t allow your arch to collapse as you complete the movement",
            "Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don\u2019t utilize a false grip",
            "Don\u2019t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won\u2019t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you\u2019ll be slow off the flow",
            "So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel",
            "To learn and master single RDLs, it may be conducive to utilize assisted versions by lightly holding onto a rack with your free hand or hinging with both legs in position like a normal RDL but keep one foot hovering off the floor",
            "If you can\u2019t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction",

The single leg exercise ball hamstring curl provides several unique challenges. For example, it challenges the core to stabilize the spine as you contract your hamstrings to bring the exercise ball towards the body. Also, as a bodyweight exercise that requires a lot of core stability, it is a self-limiting exercise. This means, you\u2019re less likely to cheat as you would if trying to increase weight used in a weighted exercise. If you struggle with this single leg variation, start off by performing the two leg exercise ball leg curl.",

        "tips": [
            "For a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you\u2019re going to be using it regularly",
            "Any higher and it\u2019ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run",
            "Stance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position",
            "Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet",
            "To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion",
            "Use the cue: \u201csqueeze oranges in your armpits\u201d, \u201cput your shoulder blades in your back pockets\u201d (i.e",
            "scapular depression) or \u201cimagine you\u2019re doing a straight arm pulldown\u201d",
            "The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter\u2019s shirt before they pull (i.e",
            "\u201cchest up\u201d)",
            "The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats",
            "Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot",
            "If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor",
            "In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you\u2019re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other",
            "This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint",
            "You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly",
            "Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e",
            "keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up",
            "Here\u2019s some factors to consider: If you\u2019re someone who is more globally extended (i.e",
            "athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension",
            "Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics",
            "Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start",
            "In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads",
            "More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the \u201cpull the slack out the bar\u201d cue as much and that\u2019s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it\u2019s an important concept to understand and implement",
            "Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy",
            "Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you",
            "Do NOT retract your shoulder blades",
            "This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion",
            "Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don\u2019t utilize a false grip",
            "Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you\u2019re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar",
            "Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn\u2019t tilt as you make your pull",
            "To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won\u2019t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you\u2019ll be slow off the flow",
            "So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel",
            "Ensure the elbows stay locked out",
            "Don\u2019t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn\u2019t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights",
            "For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it\u2019s allowed and you\u2019re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors",
            "However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors",
            "If you find that you\u2019re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you\u2019re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts",
            "You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes."

        "overview": "The reverse grip lat pull down is a variation of the lat pull down and an exercise used to build the muscles of the back. While the exercise will primarily target the lats, you will also notice a fair amount of bicep and middle back activation. The back is a muscle group that requires a fair amount of variation. So, experiment with several different angles and hand positions to maximize your back muscle growth. The reverse grip hand positioning will naturally make the biceps become more involved in the exercise. The reverse grip lat pull down can be performed during your back workouts, upper body workouts, pull workouts, and full body workouts.",

By pausing mid rep, as seen at the top of the single pause chin up, you create an isometric contraction on the muscle. This requires more strength to complete each repetition as you will come to a complete dead stop during the rep. Be sure to focus on the contraction during the pause when performing single pause chin ups. The added time under tension created while paused at contraction can help lead to a better pump and greater muscle growth in the long run.",

        "overview": "The bent over row is a back day staple exercise and is considered one of the best muscle building back building exercises you can do. Sometimes referred to as the barbell row, the bent over row is a staple movement in most muscle building workouts. Those looking to build muscle utilize the bent over row to target their back, bicep and core muscle. Those in powerlifting and strength circles perform bent over rows to increase their strength on the big 3 movements. The bent over row is typically used to build and strengthen the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius). However, it requires assistance from muscles of the low back, core, and arms to perform a bent over row correctly. There are several variations of the bent over row one can and should perform. Bent over row variations include: Dumbbell Bent Over Row One Arm Bent Over Dumbbell Row Reverse Grip Bent Over Row T-Bar Row Smith Machine Row The back is a tricky muscle group to build and strengthen. Sometimes it can help to vary the degree in which you perform the bent over row and well as the hand placement on the bar. Regardless, the bent over row is a great exercise to include in your back workout.",

Using rings to perform the inverted row will take unnecessary tension off the elbow joint. However, if you do not have access to rings or a trx system, a straight bar will work just fine. Chains provide variable resistance. As each link is picked off the ground, the exercise becomes more challenging. This can be extremely helpful if you\u2019re progressing from the bodyweight variation of this movement.",

            "You can also use an old bookbag if you have it lying around but you should load this on the front of the body instead of the back as that can pull you into excessive extension",

        "overview": "The squat is the king of all exercises, working over 256 muscles in one movement! From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan. For powerlifters, it is known as one of the \u201cbig three\u201d lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core. The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree. Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely. Some of the squat variations include: Bodyweight Squat Goblet Squat Landmine Squat Front Squat Dumbbell Squat Machine Hack Squat Smith Machine Squat The emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings. At the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely. Want to improve your squat?

            "Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck",
            "The bar should feel comfortable",
            "If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar",
            "Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability",

The mechanics are fairly similar, however, the leg press does not completely mimic the movement pattern of the squat. Nor does it work all of the muscle groups that the squat does. The leg press is best used as an accessory movement to the squat, or as a primary movement in gyms which lack the necessary equipment to train the squat movement pattern.",

Smith machine lunges can be used by bodybuilders hoping to isolate a particular muscle in the leg or any other lifter whose goal is to strengthen or build their leg muscles.

The military press is an exercise with many names and is often referred to as the shoulder press, overhead press, and strict press. The military press is used primarily to build the deltoid muscle. It also indirectly targets the other muscles of the shoulder, your triceps, and your core. Since the military press is completed standing up, it involves a lot of core strength to help stabilize the spine while pressing weight overhead. There are a number of variations to the military press you can use to target the deltoids from different angles and different ways. These military press variations include: Seated Military Press Dumbbell Military Press Seated Dumbbell Press Arnold Press Behind The Neck Military Press Smith Machine Military Press Be sure to add a variation of the military press to your shoulder workout to get the benefits from one of the most complete shoulder exercises out there.",

Not many exercises can effectively target the rear delts like the cable face pull can. The rear delt is often a lagging muscle group for many lifters and weak rear delts can result in poor posture, thus performing the cable face pull (or other rear delt exercises) is highly recommended. Add the cable face pull exercise in your body part split on either shoulder or back day, on your upper day during your upper/lower splits, or on your pull day for push/pull/leg splits.",

            "\u201cchest up\u201d)",

            "In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you\u2019re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other",
            "This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint",
            "Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e",
            "keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up",
            "Here\u2019s some factors to consider: If you\u2019re someone who is more globally extended (i.e",
            "athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin",
            "On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension",
            "Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics",
            "Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift",
            "Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy",
            "Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you",
            "Do NOT retract your shoulder blades",
            "This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion",
            "Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don\u2019t utilize a false grip",
            "Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you\u2019re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell",

        "overview": "The snatch grip barbell shrug is a variation of the barbell shrug and an exercise used to isolate the traps. The main difference in a snatch grip barbell shrug is the hand placement used. By utilizing the wider than shoulder width hand placement, you\u2019ll create slight more tension on the muscles of the traps. This is a great strategy to help build the traps as the traps are a muscle group that responds particularly well to time under tension.",

            "Assume a standing position with the bar in front of your body",

            "If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top",
            "The elbows will be tucked more than a normal bench due to the decrease grip width but if you experience shoulder pain during this variation you may have to slightly tweak grip width and elbow tuck to provide more space within the shoulder capsule",
            "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back",
            "If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you\u2019re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury",

            "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or \u201csuicide\u201d grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first",
            "Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling",
            "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip",
            "However, if you\u2019re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses",
            "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability",
            "Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production",
            "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don\u2019t allow them to change position as you press",
            "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter\u2019s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum",
            "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you",
            "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift",
            "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back",
            "Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis",
            "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to \u201cbend the bar\u201d to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder",

Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.
