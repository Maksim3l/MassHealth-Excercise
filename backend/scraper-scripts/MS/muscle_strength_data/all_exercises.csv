If you find you can’t maintain a neutral spinal position during this variation, regress to a supine version and then progress into a half kneeling and tall kneeling version once you gain the requisite lumbo-pelvic control. Do not hold your breath, you shouldn’t be using respiration to compensate for a lack of stability. Learn how to move while maintaining position without having to rely upon your breath."

Then focus on individual revolutions of the rope - allow the rope to rotate around your body, hop over it, hop again (aka the “bounce” commonly seen in skipping patterns), then rotate the wrists. It will feel somewhat staggered and disjointed but this form of segmentation (also known as “chunking”) is often necessary for motor learning with intricate skill sets. Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand. Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially. Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses. Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits. There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps. If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc). Don’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions."

Barbell Bench Press,Chest,"Shoulders, Triceps",chest,Barbell,Intermediate,Compound,Push (Bilateral),Strength,"The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program. For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body. By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way. Some of these variations include: Incline bench press Decline bench press, Dumbbell bench press Dumbbell incline bench press Dumbbell decline bench press Smith machine bench press Those with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press.

Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.

Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor. Control the descent to parallel and then drive back to the starting position by pushing through the palms. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.,"Technically there are two ways to perform dips - neither is wrong, just different movement with different purposes: Staying upright and keeping the elbows in close to increase tricep recruitment. Leaning forward with elbows wider to increase chest recruitment. If possible, keep the legs straight down while bracing the glutes and abs to limit excessive spinal movement. If no dip station with steps is available, position a box underneath the handles to boost yourself up to the bars. If no box is available, then jump into position. Don’t allow the head to jut forward during the descent. Ensure the elbows stay just short of lockout to keep tension on the triceps. Experiment with a false grip by wrapping the thumb over the bar as this may be more comfortable for some."

Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Many lifters use a thumbless grip with this machine variation as they feel it is easier to keep tension through the pecs and triceps rather than having to worry about squeezing the bar excessively tight. Squeeze the handles tightly instead of using a thumbless grip can help to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position. Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself. If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”. Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to excessive arch. Keep your feet flat on the floor and don’t allow the lower body to move during the set."

The weight will drive your shoulders into scapular depression so you want to ensure that your shoulders are set in a good position prior to lifting the weight. If performing a unilateral carry variation, ensure that you’re not leaning to one side as you complete the movement. Shrug the shoulder just slightly.

Conventional Deadlift,Hamstrings,"Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lats, Lower Back, Middle Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back",hamstrings,Barbell,Intermediate,Compound,Hinge (Bilateral),Strength,"The deadlift is an extremely popular exercise and a true test of total body strength. It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes. The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body). The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core. The conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program. For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there. Some of these deadlift variations include: Trap Bar Deadlift Romanian Deadlift Stiff Leg Deadlift Landmine Deadlift Dumbbell Deadlift Smith Machine Deadlift Grip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.",1,1,0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/deadlifts.html,https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjsu6ceEkAQ?rel=0,"Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance. Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights. In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies: The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width. You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts.

The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it. The Romanian deadlift is best utilized during your leg workouts and/or full body workouts.",1,1,0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/romanian-deadlift,https://www.youtube.com/embed/-m45n1_x32E?rel=0,Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance. Assume a double overhand grip just outside of hip width and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out. Begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.,"Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively. It is typically recommended that you utilize straps or hook grip when going excessively heavy if grip is the limiting factor as you could run into issues with the bar drifting if using mixed grip. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Do not allow the bar to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights."

You can use a grounded flat bench, but elevating it gives you a better range of motion and more efficiently recruits the hamstrings. Now choose the appropriate dumbbell and set it on the ground near the lower end of the bench. Lie face down on the bench and position yourself so that your knees are at the edge of the bench. Pick up the dumbbell from the floor with your feet, securing it between the arches of your two feet. Your legs should be fully extended and you can wrap your arms around the bench for stability.

Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates. The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible. In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other.

More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades.

Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift.

The trap bar rack pull, and other rack pull variations, can help a lifter isolate their lower back. It can also assist in building greater deadlift strength by training the lock out portion of the movement, a common sticking point for a lot of lifters. The main difference between the trap bar rack pull and other rack pull variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body. These slight changes seen in the trap bar rack pull can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.",1,1,0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/trap-bar-rack-pull,https://www.youtube.com/embed/hgEb76YkU04?rel=0,"Set up the bar at just below knee height on the safety pins in a rack. Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance. Push your hips back and hinge forward. Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the pins, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Stance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet. To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands.

Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the kettlebells to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip. Don’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights."

Those who perform it on a raised platform with a rounded back are doing it incorrectly. You should only utilize the range of motion which you can move through with control. Even though the knees are meant to be mostly locked out with this variation, you shouldn’t be focused on squeezing your quads. If you notice pain at the back of the base of the knees, simply switch to another slightly bent knee variation. This style of deadlift will look VERY similar to a conventional deadlift only the lifter will start with higher hips and a vertical shin angle. The hips and shoulders will likely be at just about the same height. Do not allow the bar to drift away from your body during the lift. Always start these out of a rack, don’t go off the floor.

There shouldn’t be any movement within your spine - don’t focus on arching your back. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Do not worry about retracting your shoulder blades, this is unnecessary and doesn’t carry over to your deadlift. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip.

Set up for the exercise by loading a barbell up with the weight you want to use. Position two flat benches side by side and place the barbell across the benches on one end. Stand securely with one foot on each bench facing the barbell with your feet around shoulder-width apart. Bend down with your knees and grasp the barbell using an overhand grip (palms facing down) with your hands around shoulder-width apart or wider. Keeping your back straight, stand straight up resting the barbell on your thighs. Get set up for the movement by pulling your shoulders back, sticking your chest out, and arching your back slightly. Keeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly bend at the hips lowering the barbell straight down close to your body. You should feel the stretch in your hamstrings! Lower the bar down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably. The elevated platform will allow for a deeper descent. Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the bar straight back up. Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding. Squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up. Repeat for desired reps.","Use extra caution when performing this exercise on a raised platform. Begin by using a lighter weight than normal to perfect the movement. You must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round! The bar needs to stay close to your body throughout the set. The further the bar is from your body the more strain is on your lower back. Focus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the bar and contracting them as you raise it back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise. It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set). You do not have to use an overhand grip on the bar. You can use an underhand grip or one over / one under. During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly. Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back, and abdominal tight as you begin the ascent. Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction! One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back. Technique is so important with this exercise.

Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly. Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back, and abdominal tight as you begin the ascent. Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction! One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back. Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight (or bar only) and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!"

Trap Bar Deficit Deadlift,Hamstrings,"Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back",hamstrings,Trap Bar,Intermediate,Compound,Hinge (Bilateral),Strength,"The trap bar deficit deadlift is a variation of the trap bar deadlift and an exercise used to target the muscles of the posterior chain. The main difference between the trap bar deficit deadlift and other deadlift variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body. These slight changes seen in the trap bar deficit deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement. The trap bar deficit deadlift also elevates the lifter, increasing the range of motion of the lift, and the total time under tension of the targeted muscle groups.",1,1,0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/trap-bar-deficit-deadlifts,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJmcdt2iAgY?rel=0,"Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor. Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","For a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run. Stance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet. To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",Trap Bar Deficit Deadlift,Hamstrings,"Abs, Adductors, Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Lats, Lower Back, Quads, Traps, Upper Back",hamstrings,Trap Bar,Intermediate,Compound,Hinge (Bilateral),Strength,"The trap bar deficit deadlift is a variation of the trap bar deadlift and an exercise used to target the muscles of the posterior chain.

Release the leg and slowly lower back to the starting position. Repeat the process on the opposite leg for the desired number of repetitions.","Ensure you grab the ankle and NOT the sole of the foot. Pulling on the sole of the shoe will place unnecessary stress on the lateral portion of the ankle which is most susceptible to ankle sprains. Remember, ankle and knee - you shouldn’t be touching your shoe. As you pull the leg upwards, ensure your chest does not round. Think about driving your head towards the ceiling as you lift.

Stand with your feet at around shoulder width apart and position the dumbbells on the floor so that they are on either side of your feet. Reach down and grab the dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing inward) and drop your hips.Your hips should be in the best, most natural position for leverage so you may need to raise or lower them slightly. Make sure your eyes are looking ahead. Your body will follow your head so keep your head up and eyes forward! Be sure to keep a straight back and never allow it to round. You are now in the starting position. Focus on standing up with the dumbbells - not pulling them from the floor, and lead with your head as you rise. Drive with your heals and explode upward (leading with your head) as you rise. As the dumbbells rise to knee level, thrust your hips forward and contract your back by bringing your shoulder blades back. Pause here for a moment and then reverse the movement by bending at the knees while slowly lowering the weight - keeping the dumbbells under strict control on the descent. Reset your stance if necessary and repeat for desired reps. Exercise Tips: The biggest mistake you can make is trying to perform deadlifts from an unnatural body position. Read and re-read the form tips presented in this guide and practice them with a moderate weight. Start the deadlift with the hips in a position of strength and maximal leverage.

From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan.

If you can’t seem to keep your torso upright when you squat with your hands behind your head then it may be a limb length issue which you can’t correct but it may also be a thoracic extension issue. Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Imagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back. Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright. Don’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe."

From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position. You don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement. On the contrary, you should have a slight forward lean and focus on keeping your lumbar spine neutral."

Move a flat bench between the rack so that one end is underneath the barbell. Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart on either side of the bench. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your buttocks touches the bench, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not ""rest"" on the bench! Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement. ​Exercise Tips: It's important that you only allow your buttocks to just touch the bench, and then raise. Don't sit down on the bench - it's cheating! The are many mistakes that can be made when squatting, so it's important that you have your technique down before you attempt squatting heavy weights. If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak. Common mistakes when squatting: Rounding the lower back: It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place. Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary straight on joints and tendons.

Rather than spending too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will very wide. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor.

Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades.

This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",Sumo High Pull,Traps,"Abs, Adductors, Biceps, Calves, Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, Shoulders, Upper Back",traps,Barbell,Beginner,Compound,Pull (Bilateral),Olympic Weightlifting,"The sumo stance high pull is a variation of the high pull and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the shoulders and traps. The sumo high pull is somewhat of a combination exercise (combining a sumo deadlift with an upright row) and will target other muscles groups such as the upper back and hamstrings. High pulls are performed explosively, and since the traps respond well to explosive movements, will help with trap muscle growth. They also have a significant amount of application in sports-specific training where explosiveness is an important indicator for performance.",1,1,0,https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/sumo-high-pull,https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_8okzWkU7E?rel=0,"Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length). Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. As the bar nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms. The bar should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement. As the bar returns back to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates. The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible. To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.

Jump up off the floor and take your weight on the bars. The key to hitting your triceps on this version of the dip is to keep your body as straight as possible and don't lean forward. This may mean not crossing your legs and keeping them hanging down. Slowly lower yourself down, keeping your eyes facing forward. Lower until your elbow is at around the same height as your shoulder, and then raise your body back up without locking your arms at the top of the movement. Repeat for desired reps.","Do not lower yourself down too far, as this can result in heavy strain on your shoulder joints and possible injury. Use the mind-muscle connection to focus on working your triceps throughout the movement. Squeeze your triceps hard at the top of the movement and feel the stretch on the way down. Do not lock your elbows out at the top of the movement. And finally, keep the rep timing slow for maximum results from this exercise."

Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.","Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.

If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."
One Arm Kettlebell Floor Press,Triceps,"Abs, Chest, Shoulders",triceps,Kettle Bells,Beginner,Compound,Push (Unilateral),Strength,"The one arm kettlebell floor press is a variation of the one arm dumbbell floor press and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the triceps.
