    "overview": "The hip abduction machine exercise is an exercise used to strengthen the abductors. The abductors play a critical role in core stability and having strong abductors can result in better personal records on the squat and deadlift. From an aesthetic perspective, performing hip abduction isolation exercises assists in the development of a full pair of glutes and hips.",
    "instructions_raw": "Setup in an upright position with your back against the pad and your spine neutral. Exhale and push the legs apart as you open the pads. Once your hips are fully externally rotated, slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Experiment with foot and pelvis position. Depending upon the shape of your hip, you may need a slightly more internal or external starting position to fully maximize the contraction. Similarly, be mindful of your pelvic position - don’t allow the back to arch as this will tip the hips forward and place the adductors under excessive stretch before the contraction which can affect force output. If you can’t seem to figure out how to change the position of your pelvis while seated, experiment with changing the position of the torso (i.e. lean forward or push your back into the pad).",

Most ab workouts include the ab crunch as it is thought to be one of the best core building exercises. However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout. The ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine. Some may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.",

    "overview": "The Decline Bench Sit Up is an effective core-strengthening exercise that targets the rectus abdominis (the main abdominal muscle) and works the hip flexors as secondary muscles. By performing this exercise on a decline bench, the angle increases the intensity of the movement, making it more challenging than a traditional floor sit up. The decline position requires greater activation of the abdominal muscles to lift the torso against gravity, helping to build strength and endurance in the core.",

Lie back on the bench and position your arms over your chest or place them behind your head for support. Exhale and squeeze your abs as you curl your upper body off the bench, bringing your chest toward your knees. Pause at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your upper body back to the starting position. This is one rep. Perform the desired number of reps, maintaining proper form and control.",
    "tips_raw": "Exhale as you lift your torso and inhale as you lower yourself back down. If you want to engage the obliques, add a twisting motion to help improve posture, stability, and overall core function. Perform the sit up slowly and with control, both while rising and lowering, to maximize muscle engagement and avoid using momentum. Keep a neutral spine position throughout the movement; don’t let your back arch too much as you lower yourself.",

The Turkish get up can be incorporated into any kind of program, but is best used as a corrective and/or warm up exercise.",
    "instructions_raw": "Setup in a side lying position with the kettle bell in a front racked position and your hands overlapped on the handle. Roll onto your back and press the kettle bell to extension with one hand. Extend your free hand to the side and raise the knee on the same side as the kettle bell.

Once the hips are extended, sweep the straight leg through and assume a half kneeling position with one hand still on the floor and the other overhead. Bring the torso upright, reposition the down leg so that it’s inline with the forward leg, and then drive up to a standing position out of the half kneeling stance.

Don’t start with heavy weight (or any weight at all if just learning the get up), use a shoe, a ball, or something else with a relatively light weight. For the initial sit-up portion of the lift, use the cue from Dan John, “Punch and crunch!” The turkish get up is mainly used a corrective exercise or warm up drill.

It also engages the hip flexors and works the obliques and lower back muscles as secondary stabilizers. This movement strengthens the muscles in the lower torso, making it beneficial for improving posture, supporting the spine, and enhancing athletic performance. The controlled motion of the leg raise helps develop both flexibility and strength in the lower body, particularly in the abdominal and hip regions.",

    "overview": "The deep squat prying drill is both an activation exercise and a drill that promotes increased mobility. The deep squat portion of the drill is beneficial in activating the muscles of the lower body including the adductors, quads, glutes, and hamstrings. The prying part of the drill helps open up the hips to promote more fluid range of motions during your working sets later in the workout. One would typically perform the deep squat prying drill at the beginning of their workouts as a dynamic stretch in their specific warm up routine.",

Slowly roll up and down the length of the adductor (groin) for 20-30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.",

Do not allow yourself to fall into hyperextension, keep tension through the abs. If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax. Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body. If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea. If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.",

The biceps is a tricky (and fun) muscle to target and putting yourself in various degrees of incline can help manipulate the range of motion for either a tighter contraction or deeper stretch. The incline dumbbell curl elongates the negative portion of the dumbbell curl, creating a deeper stretch on the biceps muscle tissue. Dumbbell curl variations are primarily popular among lifters looking to improve their aesthetics as direct arm work will have limited carry over into maximum strength.",

    "overview": "The standing Zottman curl is a variation of the standing dumbbell curl and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the biceps. The Zottman curl utilizes different hand positioning at different portions of the lift to capitalize on the strength of the lifter and maximize arm growth. The first portion, the regular curl, allows the lifter to focus on their bicep strength. The lowering portion, after already using a heavier weight than one would typically use in a dumbbell reverse curl, allows you to overload the forearms. Bicep isolation work is particularly helpful for those looking to achieve aesthetics and building a balanced physique.",
    "instructions_raw": "Select the desired weight from the rack and assume a shoulder width stance. Using a supinated grip, take a deep breath and curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders. Once the biceps are fully shortened, rotate the forearms to a pronated position (palms down) and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Don’t allow the elbows to shift behind the body. Similarly, make sure the shoulder doesn’t shift forward in the socket as you lower the weight. Maintain a slight bend in the elbow at the bottom of the movement in order to keep tension through the biceps. Rotate the forearms slowly, excessive velocity may cause issues within the elbows or wrists. Using a slow eccentric (lowering portion) of the exercise can help to improve tension and mind muscle connection.",

The dumbbell drag curl is a unique bicep curl variation in that you don’t completely bring the weight in front of your body, thus you have a more difficult time swinging and using momentum to get the weight up. People will often use the dumbbell drag curl as a finisher to their bicep workout.",

    "overview": "The seated dumbbell reverse curl is a curl variation used to target the biceps and forearms. By remaining seated during the seated dumbbell reverse curl, you eliminate the ability to arch your back and swing the weight up to the finishing position of the exercise. This provides a better isolation and contraction on the biceps. Performing curls utilizing a reverse grip, as seen in the seated dumbbell reverse curl, includes the forearms in the exercise to a far greater extent. And since you’re likely able to curl more weight than you can wrist roll, you’ll better stimulate the muscle fibers of the forearm to encourage more muscle growth.",

    "instruction_step_1": "Grasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope behind your heels. Rotate the wrists to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body. As the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one foot to allow it to pass underneath. Once the rope has passed underneath, you’ll hop again with the same foot before hopping the rope with opposite foot on the next pass. Repeat steps 4 & 5 for the desired number of repetitions or time.",
    "tip_1": "Skipping is essentially a rhythmic double jump on one leg but it is most often interpreted as a “bounce”. If you can’t seem to master the skip, try alternating hops first. Then focus on individual revolutions of the rope - allow the rope to rotate around your body, hop over it, hop again (aka the “bounce” commonly seen in skipping patterns), then rotate the wrists. It will feel somewhat staggered and disjointed but this form of segmentation (also known as “chunking”) is often necessary for motor learning with intricate skill sets. Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand. Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially. Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses. Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits. There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps. If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc). Don’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions.",

Adjust pressure into the roller by applying more or less force through the forearms and knee. Slowly roll up and down the length of the hamstring while slightly rotating the leg periodically for 20-30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.",
    "tips_raw": "The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it. Do not allow yourself to fall into hyperextension, keep tension through the abs. If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax. Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. Don’t slump into the shoulder capsule, maintain an active upper body. If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea. If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.",

Jumping rope in general requires and builds a lot of coordination, one of the most important components to human fitness. Unilateral exercises are excellent options for working one side of the body at a time to help build balanced strength and an aesthetic physique. Jump rope exercises, such as the single leg jump rope, are great calf building exercises as they provide a lot of repetition to the slow twitch muscle fibers of the calves and can be explosive by nature.",

As the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one leg to allow it to pass underneath. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions or time.",
    "tips_raw": "Hopping on a single leg requires quite a bit of hip and ankle stability. As such, if you encounter knee pain or you notice that your biomechanics are altered, consider utilizing a bilateral version and working to increase your single leg strength via training. Keep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand. Ensure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially. Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses. Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all.

    "overview": "The tiger tail is an implement used to perform a form of self myo-fascial release. Using the tiger tail on the calves is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout, especially if you plan to perform lower body exercises that require the calves to be more mobile. When you perform SMR on your calves, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "While in a seated position, position the tiger tail on the front of the calf with one hand on either handle. Adjust pressure into calf by applying more or less force through the hands. Slowly roll up and down the length of the calf for 20-30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.",
    "tips_raw": "The tibialis anterior is located lateral (towards the outside) to your shin bone so you may need to tilt the roller slightly to stay off the bone and primarily on the muscle. The most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it. If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax. In addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”. Foam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.",

Don’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses. Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits. There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.

Often times, the dumbbell bench press is recommended after reaching a certain point of strength on the barbell bench press to avoid pec and shoulder injuries. Additionally, the dumbbell bench press provides an ego check in the amount of weight used due to the need to maintain shoulder stability throughout the exercise. The exercise itself can be featured as a main lift in your workouts or an accessory lift to the bench press depending on your goals.",

Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position. Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself. Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position. Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself. If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the edge of an incline bench. To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top. Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the handles should be about level with your chest). Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. **Dropping the dumbbells to the side is discouraged unless you are experienced with the technique or using excessively heavy weights. **Ideally you should twist the dumbbells back to neutral (palms facing each other), bring your knees up so the ends of the dumbbells are touching your thighs, then use the weight of the dumbbells to rock back to an upright, seated position.",
    "tips_raw": "Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely. Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position. Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself. Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position. Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself. If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

    "overview": "The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program. For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body. By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way. Some of these variations include: Incline bench press Decline bench press, Dumbbell bench press Dumbbell incline bench press Dumbbell decline bench press Smith machine bench press Those with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.",
    "instructions_raw": "Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat in order to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.

    "instructions_raw": "Sit on the end of the bench and lie back with the handles just below shoulder height. The handles should mimic the position of the bar when benching.

Squeezing the handles tightly instead of using a thumbless grip can help to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position. Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself. If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

Chest dips effectively hit the lower region of the pec, similarly to the decline bench press. However, it follows a vertical pressing movement pattern, which provides a unique stimulus for the muscles of the chest. It is best to master the bodyweight variation of this exercise prior to adding weight via weighted vests, belts, or chains. The dip can be performed as part of your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, or full body workouts.",

If no dip station with steps is available, position a box underneath the handles to boost yourself up to the bars. If no box is available, then jump into position. Don’t allow the head to jut forward during the descent. Ensure the elbows stay just short of lockout to keep tension on the triceps.

They can be used by lifters with strength based goals, however, the exercise itself will have limited carry over into increasing maximum strength. The incline angle used during the incline dumbbell fly provides a unique challenge to the exercise and also emphasizes the upper chest. This exercise is best used on upper hypertrophy days and/or chest workouts in more traditional bodybuilding splits.",

    "overview": "The decline bench press is a variation of the bench press and an exercise used to target the muscles of the chest. It will also indirectly target the muscles of the shoulders and triceps. The decline bench press is commonly used to target the lower portion of the pecs. However, some argue that it is the most effective bench press variation for targeting the entire chest. Bench press variations can be included in your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Lie flat on an decline bench, set your hands just outside of shoulder width, and hook your feet underneath the pad. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to just below your sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.",

    "instruction_step_1": "Lie flat on an decline bench, set your hands just outside of shoulder width, and hook your feet underneath the pad. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to just below your sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tip_1": "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.",

One would use the incline machine bench press as a way to perform the pressing movement pattern with a focus on isolating the chest. One can better isolate certain muscle groups with a machine due to its fixed movement pattern. The machine incline bench press is best added towards the end of your chest workout if you are training for hypertrophy, after you’ve used other more compound variations to work your push muscles.",

Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position.

If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”.

By using dumbbells during a decline bench press, you allow yourself for a greater range of motion during the exercise.

The decline dumbbell bench press is a chest exercise that also indirectly targets the shoulders, triceps, and core. The decline angle used during a decline dumbbell bench press is useful for those attempting to build the lower part of their chest.",
    "instructions_raw": "Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in).

Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position.

Ironically enough, the decline push up mimics the same movement pattern as the incline bench press and is an excellent exercise to use to target the upper chest.",
    "instructions_raw": "Assume a quadruped position with your shoulders underneath your hands, toes tucked, and knees under hips. Extend one leg at a time onto a bench behind you and assume a push up position with the legs straight, elbows extended, and head in a neutral position looking at the floor. Slowly descend to the floor by retracting the shoulder blades and unlocking the elbows. Descend until your chest touches the floor. Push back to the starting point by extending the elbows and driving your palms into the floor. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Your arms should resemble an arrow in the bottom position, not a “T”. Your spine should remain rigid throughout the entire exercise, think of the push up as a moving plank. Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs before descending to keep the ribcage neutral. Keep the chin down and don’t look forward. Imagine you’re trying to push your thumbs together while completing the movement, this will improve activation of the pecs. Don’t allow the head to jut forward, the chest should touch at the same time as your nose. Think about trying to push yourself as far away from the floor as possible. Ensure you push all the way through the floor at the top of the repetition and allow your shoulder blades to move around your ribcage. Most folks cut the repetition short and don’t garner the full benefits as such.",

The muscles targeted include the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Performing exercises on an exercise ball also provides a core stability challenge as you balance your body and maintain perfect form on the ball. Some implement this training modality on beginners during balance and strength building phases. You can perform exercise ball dumbbell bench press during your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on a physioball. To get into position, roll down the physioball while keeping the dumbbells close to your chest. Once your upper back is in position on the physioball, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top. Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the upper arm should be close to parallel with the floor). Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. **Dropping the dumbbells to the side is discouraged unless you are experienced with the technique or using excessively heavy weights. **Ideally you should twist the dumbbells back to neutral (palms facing each other), bring your knees up so the ends of the dumbbells are touching your thighs, then use the weight of the dumbbells to rock back to an upright, seated position.",
    "tips_raw": "Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely. Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle to keep the elbows in a neutral position. Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself. Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure the shoulders remain in a safe position. Imagine you’re trying to push yourself away from the weights rather than pushing the weights away from yourself. If you’re feeling pain within the shoulder joint itself (specifically at the front), ensure your shoulder blades are slightly retracted and try to keep the shoulder girdle “packed”. Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to excessive arch. Keep your feet flat on the floor and don’t allow the lower body to move during the set.",

The neutral grip when pressing is popular among those with joint discomfort as it can put some of the major joints (shoulders, wrists, and elbows) in a more favorable pressing position. Incline variations of pressing are also popular as supplemental movements and accessory work for both athletes looking to increase their strength and improve their aesthetics. For instance, from an aesthetic standpoint, using an incline can help you better target the upper chest.

If you’re unable to perform straight bar dips, going the self-assisted route is the way to go. By focusing on the eccentric portion of the straight bar dip and assisting yourself through the concentric portion, you’ll build the pre-requisite strength needed to progress to the full bodyweight variation.",

If a straight bar dip station isn’t available, then simply set a bar on J hooks at the appropriate height in a rack. If no dip station with steps is available, position a box underneath the handles to boost yourself up to the bars. If no box is available, then jump into position. Don’t allow the head to jut forward during the descent. Ensure the elbows stay just short of lock out to keep tension on the triceps.

Your hands should be placed around shoulder-width apart. Stand straight up with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bending only at the wrists, let the barbell drop as far as possible. This is the starting position for the exercise. Slowly raise the barbell as far as possible squeezing the forearm muscles at the top of the movement. Only your wrists should be moving. Pause and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",

For added intensity: Keep the rep timing slow, and pause/squeeze the forearms for a count of two at the top of the movement. Use a full range of motion by allowing the weight to drop as far as possible at the bottom of the movement. When finished, lower the bar to a rack or bend at the knees and lower it to the floor.",

The weight will drive your shoulders into scapular depression so you want to ensure that your shoulders are set in a good position prior to lifting the weight. If performing a unilateral carry variation, ensure that you’re not leaning to one side as you complete the movement. Shrug the shoulders just slightly. Not enough so that it takes above a position of neutral but just enough to offset the weight pulling your shoulders down. Walk slowly and ensure a heel-toe pattern. Stabilize the weight and don’t allow it to drive you into overextension. Continue to breath throughout the exercise and don’t rely upon respiration for spinal stabilization.",

    "overview": "The one-arm reverse grip dumbbell wrist curl is an exercise used to target the muscles of the forearms. Having strong forearms, and training the forearms in multiple ways, will allow you to lift heavier weights in many exercises simply by strengthening your grip. Performing unilateral movements can also help improve weaknesses, balance your strength and aesthetic physique, and work towards reducing injuries by addressing imbalances in the body. Forearms can be a resistant muscle to grow and may require a higher training frequency to experience a noticeable difference in forearm strength and size.",

It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea. If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension.

Sit on the end of the bench facing the cable machine with your feet out slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up) with your hands around shoulder width apart. Pull the weight back and bury your elbows into your inner thighs for support. Keeping your elbows fixed and bending only at the wrists, let the bar drop as far as possible. This is the starting position for the exercise. Slowly raise the bar as far as possible squeezing the forearm muscles at the top of the movement. Pause, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",

Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",

On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",

Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",

    "instructions_raw": "In a seated position keep the knees up, feet flat, and upper body supported with your hands. Rotate both legs to the floor while keeping the knees at 90 degrees. Lean forward over the knee until you feel a stretch in the glute, then rotate both legs in the opposite direction while keeping the feet on the floor. Repeat on the opposite leg for the desired time or number of repetitions.",

    "instructions_raw": "Set a bar just below shoulder height in a rack and adjust the safeties to just above hip height.

Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.

    "overview": "The deadlift is an extremely popular exercise and a true test of total body strength. It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes. The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body). The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core. The conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program. For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there. Some of these deadlift variations include: Trap Bar Deadlift Romanian Deadlift Stiff Leg Deadlift Landmine Deadlift Dumbbell Deadlift Smith Machine Deadlift Grip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.",
    "instructions_raw": "Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance. Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights. In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. The knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies: The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width. You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",

    "tips_raw": "Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates. The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible. In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",

The trap bar deadlift is often seen as a quad dominant variation of the deadlift, and while it does incorporate the quads to a larger degree than some other deadlift variations, it still is a hip hinge movement. And hip hinges should be primarily felt through the hamstrings and glutes. The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it. The trap bar deadlift is best utilized during your leg workouts and/or full body workouts.",

To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",

A smart option, to increase training frequency and work on the movement pattern, would be to perform RDLs on your leg day and another deadlift variation on your back or pull days. The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it. The landmine implement provides a somewhat fixed movement pattern to take some of the stress of the stabilizing muscle groups to help emphasize hamstring usage and limit potential injuries from other variations.

Keep a soft bend in your knee and don’t allow your arch to collapse as you complete the movement. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip. Don’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. To learn and master single RDLs, it may be conducive to utilize assisted versions by lightly holding onto a rack with your free hand or hinging with both legs in position like a normal RDL but keep one foot hovering off the floor.",

Kettlebell Romanian deadlifts are an excellent exercise to use when learning the hip hinge movement before moving on to heavier and more advanced variations.",
    "instructions_raw": "Grasp a kettlebell by the horns with a double overhand grip and assume a hip width stance.

Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the range of motion to control that much range of motion effectively. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Do not allow the kettlebell to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.",

    "overview": "The exercise ball hamstring curl is a leg curl variation used to build and strengthen the muscles of the hamstring complex. The exercise ball hamstring curl provides several unique challenges. For example, it challenges the core to stabilize the spine as you contract your hamstrings to bring the exercise ball towards the body. Also, as a bodyweight exercise that requires a lot of core stability, it is a self-limiting exercise. This means, you’re less likely to cheat as you would if trying to increase weight used in a weighted exercise. Instead, your goal should be to execute the exercise with perfect form before progressing to a more challenging single leg variation.",

If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension. If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction. If you want to improve activation of your abs and hamstrings within the movement, consider squeezing something like a foam roller or yoga block in between your knees. Keep the hips up but also press into the roller/block as you curl the legs in. Don’t allow the hips to swivel as you curl the legs in.",

For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates. The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other.

If you don’t have access to anyone who can hold your ankles in place, consider a setup with a power rack whereby your ankles are positioned underneath the squat pad on a weighted barbell and you have a pad underneath your knees. You can also wrap the band around your chest if you prefer a hands free version. However, if you grab the band behind the head you can modify where your hands are placed, thus allowing yourself more or less assistance as needed. Ideally you should look to keep your hips extended throughout the duration of the set, don’t allow them to shoot back and take tension off of your hamstrings. Remember, bands return what is requested - the more you stretch them, the more they assist you. If you need more, simply grip higher on the band. When extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back. If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension.",

    "overview": "The trap bar Romanian deadlift is a variation of the Romanian deadlift and an exercise used to target the entire posterior chain. The main difference between the trap bar Romanian deadlift and other Romanian deadlift variation is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body. These slight changes seen in the trap bar Romanian deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.",
    "instructions_raw": "Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance. Assume a neutral grip on the handles and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out. Begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Range of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the range of motion to control that much range of motion effectively. It may be easier to utilize the trap bar given the load is distributed on both sides of the body rather than in front. Since this is the case, it can be thought of as a progression into normal RDLs. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Do not allow the bar to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Your weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.",

Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Finish the movement by squeezing the glutes and posteriorly tilting the pelvis. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Make no mistake, your lower back should not round during this exercise. Those who perform it on a raised platform with a rounded back are doing it incorrectly. You should only utilize the range of motion which you can move through with control. Even though the knees are meant to be mostly locked out with this variation, you shouldn’t be focused on squeezing your quads. If you notice pain at the back of the base of the knees, simply switch to another slightly bent knee variation. This style of deadlift will look VERY similar to a conventional deadlift only the lifter will start with higher hips and a vertical shin angle. The hips and shoulders will likely be at just about the same height. Do not allow the bar to drift away from your body during the lift. Always start these out of a rack, don’t go off the floor. Most won’t have the requisite hamstring mobility to complete the movement from the floor. The movement occurs primarily at your hips. There shouldn’t be any movement within your spine - don’t focus on arching your back. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Do not worry about retracting your shoulder blades, this is unnecessary and doesn’t carry over to your deadlift. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. When you hip hinge, you should naturally notice a weight shift to your heels. However, don’t shift your weight so aggressively that your heels come up. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow.

    "instruction_step_1": "Set a bar at just below hip height and load your desired weight. Hinge forward slightly and grasp the bar with a double overhand, shoulder width grip. Stand up by extending your hips and knees and take two steps back from the rack. Keeping the knees extended, push your hips back, and hinge forward until the bar is just below your knee cap. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Finish the movement by squeezing the glutes and posteriorly tilting the pelvis. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tip_1": "Make no mistake, your lower back should not round during this exercise. Those who perform it on a raised platform with a rounded back are doing it incorrectly. You should only utilize the range of motion which you can move through with control. Even though the knees are meant to be mostly locked out with this variation, you shouldn’t be focused on squeezing your quads. If you notice pain at the back of the base of the knees, simply switch to another slightly bent knee variation. This style of deadlift will look VERY similar to a conventional deadlift only the lifter will start with higher hips and a vertical shin angle. The hips and shoulders will likely be at just about the same height. Do not allow the bar to drift away from your body during the lift. Always start these out of a rack, don’t go off the floor. Most won’t have the requisite hamstring mobility to complete the movement from the floor. The movement occurs primarily at your hips. There shouldn’t be any movement within your spine - don’t focus on arching your back. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Do not worry about retracting your shoulder blades, this is unnecessary and doesn’t carry over to your deadlift. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. When you hip hinge, you should naturally notice a weight shift to your heels. However, don’t shift your weight so aggressively that your heels come up. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out.

One of the main difference between the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift and other Romanian deadlift variation is the use of the landmine implement. Use of the landmine provides a fix plane of motion for the lifter to complete the exercise in. It also challenges the grip strength of the lifter who now must grasp the thickest portion of the barbell. The other difference is the fact that the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a unilateral exercise. This allows you to target each side of the body at a time to build a more aesthetic physique as well as balanced strength.",

Reset and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Focus on pushing your heel back as far as possible and hinging into the hip rather than dropping your chest. Don’t allow the hips to rotate, you should be able to balance a cup of water on your back in the bottom of the movement. Your chin should follow your chest, don’t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement. Ideally you should keep a straight line from your head through your heel. Keep a soft bend in your knee and don’t allow your arch to collapse as you complete the movement. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip. Don’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. To learn and master single RDLs, it may be conducive to utilize assisted versions by lightly holding onto a rack with your free hand or hinging with both legs in position like a normal RDL but keep one foot hovering off the floor. If you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.

Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back, and abdominal tight as you begin the ascent. Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction! One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back. Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, use a very light weight (or bar only) and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!",

    "instruction_step_1": "Set up for the exercise by loading a smith machine with the weight you want to use. Set the bar to the lowest setting. Stand facing the barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend down with your knees and grasp the barbell using an overhand grip (palms facing down) with your hands around shoulder-width apart or wider. Keeping your back straight, stand straight up resting the bar on your thighs. Get set up for the movement by pulling your shoulders back, sticking your chest out, and arching your back slightly. Keeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly bend at the hips lowering the barbell straight down close to your body. You should feel the stretch in your hamstrings! Lower the bar down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably. Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the bar straight back up. Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding. Squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up. Repeat for desired reps.",
    "tip_1": "You must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round! The bar needs to stay close to your body throughout the set. The further the bar is from your body the more strain is on your lower back. Focus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the bar and contracting them as you raise back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise. It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set). You do not have to use an overhand grip on the bar. You can use an underhand grip or one over / one under. During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels.

    "overview": "The trap bar deficit deadlift is a variation of the trap bar deadlift and an exercise used to target the muscles of the posterior chain. The main difference between the trap bar deficit deadlift and other deadlift variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body. These slight changes seen in the trap bar deficit deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement. The trap bar deficit deadlift also elevates the lifter, increasing the range of motion of the lift, and the total time under tension of the targeted muscle groups.",
    "instructions_raw": "Stand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor. Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips. Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "For a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run. Stance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet. To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Given most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads. More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Ensure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull. To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights. For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors. If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.",

    "overview": "The pull up is a classic exercise and one used to target the upper back muscles such as the latissimus dorsi. Vertical pulling movements, such as the pull up, are foundational movements that should be included in your workout routines. So, once you’ve found a variation you like and feels comfortable to you, master it as it will benefit you from a strength and aesthetic standpoint. The pull up can be incorporated into back workouts, pull workouts, upper body workouts, or full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Using a pronated grip, grasp the pull bar with a slightly wider than shoulder width grip. Take a deep breath, squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. Depress the shoulder blades and then drive the elbows straight down to the floor while activating the lats. Pull your chin towards the bar until the lats are fully contracted, then slowly lower yourself back to the start position and repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "To decrease bicep involvement, use a false (thumbless) grip. Try to keep a neutral head position (looking straight ahead or slightly up) as hyperextending the neck can lead to compensations throughout the spine. If the bar is high enough, keep the legs straight and in front of the body in a hollow body position. Avoid falling into overextension of the lumbar spine by squeezing your glutes and bracing your abs. The pullup is completed when the lats are fully flexed, don’t continue pulling and compensate with the pecs. When this occurs, the elbows will flare up behind the body, the shoulder will round forward, and you’ll begin to feel pressure in the front of your shoulders. A lifter’s segment length will determine whether or not they can actually get their chin over the bar, it’s not an absolute for everyone. Lower to almost full extension of the elbow but avoid locking out completely as this can place excessive strain on the ligamentous structures within the elbow and shoulder. If you can’t complete a single bodyweight pullup, start with slow negatives (add weight when these can be accomplished under control) or flexed arm hangs in the top position.

While the exercise will primarily target the lats, you will also notice a fair amount of bicep and middle back activation. The back is a muscle group that requires a fair amount of variation. So, experiment with several different angles and hand positions to maximize your back muscle growth. The reverse grip hand positioning will naturally make the biceps become more involved in the exercise. The reverse grip lat pull down can be performed during your back workouts, upper body workouts, pull workouts, and full body workouts.",

Ensure you have a heavy pad of some sort underneath the rope if you’re just learning in case your hands slip. Chalk is especially important for rope climbs as your hands get sweaty. If your hands get especially torn up from descending the rope and allowing yourself to slide down, you can wear gloves if desired. DO NOT jump down from the top of the rope once you’re done climbing.

The archer pull up incorporates a slight unilateral effect, allowing the lifter to emphasize one lat at a time.

The hold and shift also increases the time under tension of the muscle, which can help in building bigger lats.",

    "overview": "The grip ball pull up is a variation of the pull up and an exercise used to build the lats and upper back. By utilizing grip balls while performing pull ups, you’ll also include an additional grip challenge that will strengthen the muscles of the hands and forearms. Grip ball pull ups can be beneficial if you find your grip tends to limit the amount of weight you are able to hold onto during various exercises.",
    "instructions_raw": "Using a pronated grip, grasp grip balls with a slightly wider than shoulder width grip. Take a deep breath, squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. Depress the shoulder blades and then drive the elbows straight down to the floor while activating the lats. Pull your chin towards the bar until the lats are fully contracted, then slowly lower yourself back to the start position and repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "To decrease bicep involvement, use a false (thumbless grip). Try to keep a neutral head position (looking straight ahead or slightly up) as hyperextending the neck can lead to compensations throughout the spine. If the bar is high enough, keep the legs straight and in front of the body in a hollow body position. Avoid falling into overextension of the lumbar spine by squeezing your glutes and bracing your abs. The pull up is completed when the lats are fully flexed, don’t continue pulling and compensate with the pecs. When this occurs, the elbows will flare up behind the body, the shoulder will round forward, and you’ll begin to feel pressure in the front of your shoulders. A lifter’s segment length will determine whether or not they can actually get their chin over the bar, it’s not an absolute for everyone. Lower to almost full extension of the elbow but avoid locking out completely as this can place excessive strain on the ligamentous structures within the elbow and shoulder. If you can’t complete a single bodyweight pull up, start with slow negatives (add weight when these can be accomplished under control) or flexed arm hangs in the top position. Ditch the kips, neither one is necessary or recommended.",

If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax. Foam rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.",

Given your having to support your full bodyweight with one hand during a specific point of the pull, these can be used as a progression to single arm pullups. As you slide down you may want to pinch the rope in between your feet to help displace some of the friction from your hands. Ensure that you’re using the feet correctly as they will provide much of the force which propels your body upwards. If you can’t complete normal bodyweight pullups or chinups then do not attempt to climb a rope on your own. Ensure you have a heavy pad of some sort underneath the rope if you’re just learning in case your hands slip. Chalk is especially important for rope climbs as your hands get sweaty. If your hands get especially torn up from descending the rope and allowing yourself to slide down, you can wear gloves if desired. DO NOT jump down from the top of the rope once you’re done climbing.

    "overview": "The single pause chin up is a chin up variation that utilizes an intensity technique known as the pause rep. By pausing mid rep, as seen at the top of the single pause chin up, you create an isometric contraction on the muscle. This requires more strength to complete each repetition as you will come to a complete dead stop during the rep. Be sure to focus on the contraction during the pause when performing single pause chin ups. The added time under tension created while paused at contraction can help lead to a better pump and greater muscle growth in the long run.",

Stand with your feet at around shoulder width apart and position the dumbbells on the floor so that they are on either side of your feet. Reach down and grab the dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing inward) and drop your hips.Your hips should be in the best, most natural position for leverage so you may need to raise or lower them slightly. Make sure your eyes are looking ahead. Your body will follow your head so keep your head up and eyes forward! Be sure to keep a straight back and never allow it to round. You are now in the starting position. Focus on standing up with the dumbbells - not pulling them from the floor, and lead with your head as you rise. Drive with your heals and explode upward (leading with your head) as you rise. As the dumbbells rise to knee level, thrust your hips forward and contract your back by bringing your shoulder blades back. Pause here for a moment and then reverse the movement by bending at the knees while slowly lowering the weight - keeping the dumbbells under strict control on the descent. Reset your stance if necessary and repeat for desired reps. Exercise Tips: The biggest mistake you can make is trying to perform deadlifts from an unnatural body position. Read and re-read the form tips presented in this guide and practice them with a moderate weight. Start the deadlift with the hips in a position of strength and maximal leverage. If you start the deadlift with your hips too high you will be at a mechanical disadvantage and will tax your lower back. Starting with your hips too low will also cause you to lose your leverage and power. If you start the deadlift while looking down, there is a good chance your hips will lift up causing you to lose form and lift with your lower back. This is a very common deadlift mistake.

Sometimes referred to as the barbell row, the bent over row is a staple movement in most muscle building workouts. Those looking to build muscle utilize the bent over row to target their back, bicep and core muscle. Those in powerlifting and strength circles perform bent over rows to increase their strength on the big 3 movements. The bent over row is typically used to build and strengthen the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius). However, it requires assistance from muscles of the low back, core, and arms to perform a bent over row correctly. There are several variations of the bent over row one can and should perform. Bent over row variations include: Dumbbell Bent Over Row One Arm Bent Over Dumbbell Row Reverse Grip Bent Over Row T-Bar Row Smith Machine Row The back is a tricky muscle group to build and strengthen. Sometimes it can help to vary the degree in which you perform the bent over row and well as the hand placement on the bar. Regardless, the bent over row is a great exercise to include in your back workout.",
    "instructions_raw": "Assume a standing position while holding the bar using a double overhand grip. Hinge forward until your torso is roughly parallel with the floor (or slightly above) and then begin the movement by driving the elbows behind the body while retracting the shoulder blades. Pull the bar towards your belly button until it touches your body and then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position under control. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Experiment with head position and see which option (looking forward vs. packing the neck) works better for you. Keep some tone through your abdominals as you pull the bar into your body to ensure you don’t arch excessively through your spine. Don’t allow momentum to dictate the movement, control the bar throughout the entirety of each rep. Don’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull. Similarly, ensure the shoulder blade moves on the rib cage. Don’t lock the shoulder blade down and just move through the glenohumeral joint.",

Using kettlebells to perform the bent over row provides a unique challenge in the form of an untraditional implement. The way kettlebells are designed, the weight is below the handle, allowing for gravity to challenge your grip strength more so than a dumbbell would. Also, kettlebells can be extremely beneficial in helping lifters maintain a neutral grip to alleviate joint pain commonly associated with other implements.",

    "overview": "The thoracic extension on foam roller drill is a form of dynamic stretching that warms up the muscles of the upper back. Dynamic stretching is critical prior to performing your workouts as it allows you to activate your central nervous system and engage the muscle groups you’ll use later in your workout. Incorporating them into your warm up routine will help you get better results and avoid injury.",

    "overview": "The rock back extension rotation drill is a form of dynamic stretching that warm up the muscles of the upper back and shoulders. Dynamic stretching is critical prior to performing your workouts as it allows you to activate your central nervous system and engage the muscle groups you’ll use later in your workout. Incorporating them into your warm up routine will help you get better results and avoid injury.",
    "instructions_raw": "Setup in a quadruped position with your hands directly underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. Ensure that your toes are tucked underneath and your ankles are flexed. Push your hips back and exhale while keeping your pelvis neutral. Once your hips are slightly below parallel, put one hand on the back of your head, exhale, and rotate your upper back towards the ceiling by leading with the elbow and following with your eyes. Once you run out of range of motion within the upper back, rotate back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.",
    "tips_raw": "Don’t use momentum during the rotation, control the movement actively using your musculature. As you rotate, make sure your head and eyes follow your hand. Don’t allow the hips to change position as your upper back rotates. The movement should be relegated to only your shoulders. Make sure not to push the head forward with the hand as you rotate.",

    "overview": "The ring inverted row with chains is a variation of the inverted row and an exercise used to train the muscles of the back and rear deltoid. Using rings to perform the inverted row will take unnecessary tension off the elbow joint. However, if you do not have access to rings or a trx system, a straight bar will work just fine. Chains provide variable resistance. As each link is picked off the ground, the exercise becomes more challenging. This can be extremely helpful if you’re progressing from the bodyweight variation of this movement.",
    "instructions_raw": "Adjust a set of rings to roughly chest height. Drape a loop of chains over each shoulder and sit down beneath the rings while grasping them with a neutral grip. Drive your heels into the ground, extend your hips, and keep your arms locked out. Your body should be in a straight line with your arms perpendicular to your torso. Pull yourself towards the rings by driving the elbows back and retracting the shoulder blades. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "To scale the movement, one may have to lower or raise the height of the rings. The closer you are to perpendicular with the floor, the tougher the movement will be. If regular repetitions with the addition of chains or a weight vest are too easy, progress by elevating the feet. You can also use an old bookbag if you have it lying around but you should load this on the front of the body instead of the back as that can pull you into excessive extension. For other forms of progression, you can add fat grips or utilize single arm versions but just remember, this is about movement quality. Just because an exercise is hard doesn’t mean it’s better, work within your wheelhouse and don’t force progression if you haven’t mastered the fundamentals. Don’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull. Keep the ribcage down and don’t focus on arching the back or forcing the chest up excessively. Make a straight line from your head to your heels. If you find the biceps take over primarily, then utilize a thumbless grip and think about leading the movement with your elbows. Your hands are just hooks at this point, focus on your upper back. You can utilize a bar for inverted rows but most times it’s easier on the elbows and wrists to use rings.",

Primarily, the batwing reverse sled drag will target the muscles of the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves as you fight to pull the sled the desired distance. The contracted row positioning of the arms will also create isometric tension on the muscles of the back. Sled drags can be an extremely beneficial conditioning exercise or they can be used as a strength building exercise depending on how you fit them into your workout routine.",
    "instructions_raw": "Load the desired weight onto the sled and attach a set of handles with a nylon strap. Setup in an athletic position with your body inclined away from the sled at roughly 45 degrees and your arms extended. Row the handles and allow them to rotate as you assume an underhand grip. Hold the contracted row position as you drive the sled backwards by extending the leg and hip of each leg. Repeat until you reach the desired number of steps, distance, or time.",
    "tips_raw": "For reverse drags ensure that you keep tension through the upper back and don’t allow the shoulder blades to excessively protract as this will cause the upper back to round. If you don’t have access to a sled, you can drag a car or even a plate across astroturf. Some prefer to pull with the head down while others would rather look up. This is somewhat personal preference but it will also depend upon the individual and how they present in a resting position. If someone exhibits more extension bias then they may want to experiment with looking down as this will help to keep them a bit more neutral. If someone exhibits more flexion bias then they may want to experiment with looking up as this will help to drive more extension and keep them a bit more neutral. Given sled pushes/drags don’t have any eccentric component they can very beneficial to incorporate during rehab, as a method of conditioning which won’t incur excessive soreness or load joints excessively.",

The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism. HOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area.

    "overview": "The squat is the king of all exercises, working over 256 muscles in one movement! From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan. For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core. The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree. Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely. Some of the squat variations include: Bodyweight Squat Goblet Squat Landmine Squat Front Squat Dumbbell Squat Machine Hack Squat Smith Machine Squat The emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings. At the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely. Want to improve your squat?

    "instructions_raw": "Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use. Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.",
    "tips_raw": "The are many mistakes that can be made when squatting, so it's important that you have your technique down before you attempt squatting heavy weights. If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak. Common mistakes when squatting: Rounding the lower back: It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place. Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right. Leaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down. Knees come too far forward: When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes. Not squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor. Knees in or out: Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints. Looking down: As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.",

As you lock out the knees, exhale to complete the repetition. Slowly lower your feet back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Ensure the axis of rotation for the knee directly matches that of the machine. In other words, the point of rotation for the machine should be in line with your knee joint itself. If the knee is positioned too far in front or behind the axis of rotation, there will be excessive stress added to the joint which could cause significant injury. Typically extensions should not be done excessively heavy due to the lack of hamstring co-contraction with the quads. When one occurs in isolation it could present an injury risk to the knee if done with excessive weight. Pointing the toes can help to enhance mind muscle connection.",

Sit down and position your shins behind the pad at the base of the machine. Take a deep breath and extend your legs as you flex your quadriceps. As you lock out the knees, exhale to complete the repetition. Slowly lower your feet back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tip_1": "Ensure the axis of rotation for the knee directly matches that of the machine. In other words, the point of rotation for the machine should be in line with your knee joint itself. If the knee is positioned too far in front or behind the axis of rotation, there will be excessive stress added to the joint which could cause significant injury. Typically extensions should not be done excessively heavy due to the lack of hamstring co-contraction with the quads. When one occurs in isolation it could present an injury risk to the knee if done with excessive weight. Pointing the toes can help to enhance mind muscle connection.",

    "overview": "The dumbbell lunge targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves while also engaging the core for stability. This exercise is a unilateral movement, meaning it primarily works one leg at a time. By challenging each leg independently, it improves lower body strength, balance, and coordination. It also mimics functional movements, improving flexibility and mobility in the hips and legs. The lunge is a foundational movement pattern that should be incorporated into every workout program and trained fairly frequently. Those looking to add lunges into their own workout programs should follow the single-leg sample progression scheme outlined in the notes below.",
    "instructions_raw": "Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand by your sides. Step forward with one leg, lowering your body until both knees are bent at about 90 degrees. The front knee should be aligned with your ankle, and the back knee should slightly touch, or hover just above the ground. Push off your front foot, specifically the heel, to return to the starting position. Alternate legs and repeat for the desired number of reps.",
    "tips_raw": "Keep your front knee in line with your toes, not extending past them. This helps protect your joints and ensures proper form. Keep your core tight throughout the movement to stabilize your torso and protect your lower back. Lower yourself slowly and under control. Don’t drop into the lunge too quickly, and push back to the starting position with control. Start with bodyweight lunges to master the movement. Once comfortable, gradually add light dumbbells, focusing on form first. Keep in mind that with any sort of lunge or split squat pattern, if you want to emphasize the quads, focus on taking a slightly smaller step and driving up through the ball of the foot, If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during any sort of lunge or split squat pattern, focus on taking a slightly larger step and driving up through the heel of the foot. Forward lunges are a more advanced progression and should only be utilized once one has the requisite hip and core stability. In general, a proper single-leg progression scheme might look like this: Step Up Split Squat > Front foot elevated Reverse Lunge > Front foot elevated Single Leg Squat to Bench Lateral Lunge Bulgarian/Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat (RFESS) Single Leg Squat From Bench Walking Lunge Forward Lunge Single Leg Skater Squat Pistol Squat",

    "tips_raw": "Start by using bodyweight to ensure a strong foundation in the movement. Increase the difficulty by raising the platform. The higher the platform, the more intense the exercise. When stepping up, drive through the heel of the foot on the step. This engages the glutes and hamstrings more effectively, reducing stress on the knee. Avoid using momentum. Control both the upward and downward phases to get the most out of the exercise and reduce the risk of injury.

    "overview": "The dumbbell Bulgarian split squat is an excellent exercise for those looking to build a stronger squat personal record. It can also be used to correct muscle imbalances some might experience over the years from strictly focusing on bilateral leg movements. The dumbbell Bulgarian split squat is a variation of the dumbbell lunge in which you elevate your rear foot. The elevation shifts the emphasis to the grounded foot and allows pressure to be placed directly on the quad. The dumbbell Bulgarian split squat is best considered an accessory movement, however, one can utilize them as a primary quad building exercise depending on their goals.",
    "instructions_raw": "Set up in a split stance position while grasping dumbbells by your side with a neutral grip. Position the back foot on a bench or circular pad to increase the range of motion. Descend by flexing the front knee and continue until the back knee touches the ground directly beneath the hip. Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "You can utilize a bench for this variation but it may be slightly more uncomfortable on the ankle joint. As such, it may be wiser to use the pad on the leg extension machine or perhaps the squat pad attached to a bar at a lower height. Ideally the back foot should be positioned at knee height or slightly below. Setting the back foot too high will likely just drive your lumbar spine into excessive extension. If you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot. If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot. If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your spine neutral and load the front leg more effectively. If the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position. You don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement. On the contrary, you should have a slight forward lean and focus on keeping your lumbar spine neutral.",

    "instruction_step_1": "Set up with your feet shoulder width apart and a dumbbell in each hand. Step forward with one leg and allow both knees to bend simultaneously. Descend until the back knee touches the floor. Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you stand up fully and return to the starting position. Repeat on the opposite leg. Repeat the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tip_1": "Do not progress to the elevated version until you have fully mastered the bodyweight version of this movement. Adding range of motion without having the requisite motor control is a recipe for disaster. Learn to walk before you try to run. Walking lunges are a more advanced progression and should only be utilized once one has the requisite hip and core stability. In general, a proper single leg progression scheme might look like this: Step Up Split Squat > Front foot elevated Reverse Lunge > Front foot elevated Single Leg Squat to Bench Lateral Lunge Bulgarian/Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat (RFESS) Single Leg Squat From Bench Walking Lunge Forward Lunge Single Leg Skater Squat Pistol Squat Don’t rush the progression scheme, earn the right to use every exercise and don’t neglect any of them. When you go to push back to the starting position, fight the urge to lead the movement with your shoulders by hyperextending at your spine. Instead, look to drive the movement via force from your lower body. In the bottom of the movement both of your legs should be at 90 degree angles at the knees. Keep in mind that with any sort of lunge or split squat pattern, if you want to emphasize the quads, focus on taking a slightly smaller step and drive up through the ball of the foot. If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during any sort of lunge or split squat pattern, focus on taking a slightly larger step and drive up through the heel of the foot.",

If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your neutral and load the front leg more effectively. If the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position. You don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement.

Drive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel. Some forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.

Smith machine lunges can be used by bodybuilders hoping to isolate a particular muscle in the leg or any other lifter whose goal is to strengthen or build their leg muscles.

If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your neutral and load the front leg more effectively. If the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position. You don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement.

Move a flat bench between the rack so that one end is underneath the barbell. Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart on either side of the bench. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your buttocks touches the bench, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not \"rest\" on the bench! Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement. ​Exercise Tips: It's important that you only allow your buttocks to just touch the bench, and then raise. Don't sit down on the bench - it's cheating! The are many mistakes that can be made when squatting, so it's important that you have your technique down before you attempt squatting heavy weights. If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak. Common mistakes when squatting: Rounding the lower back: It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place. Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary straight on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right. Leaning forward: This happens when your hip move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this, keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down. Knees come too far forward: When you squat down your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Not squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor. Knees in or out: Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.

Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself while positioning your feet wider than shoulder width and pointing them out. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement. Exercise Tips: It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place. Don't push from the balls of your feet. This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right. Don't lean forward. This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down. Don't allow your knees to come too far forward. When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes. Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor. Never look down! As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.",

The military press is an exercise with many names and is often referred to as the shoulder press, overhead press, and strict press. The military press is used primarily to build the deltoid muscle. It also indirectly targets the other muscles of the shoulder, your triceps, and your core. Since the military press is completed standing up, it involves a lot of core strength to help stabilize the spine while pressing weight overhead. There are a number of variations to the military press you can use to target the deltoids from different angles and different ways. These military press variations include: Seated Military Press Dumbbell Military Press Seated Dumbbell Press Arnold Press Behind The Neck Military Press Smith Machine Military Press Be sure to add a variation of the military press to your shoulder workout to get the benefits from one of the most complete shoulder exercises out there.",

Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs as you press. You shouldn’t be leaning back excessively as you press. Imagine you’re trying to look out a window at the top, your ears should be in line with your biceps. If your shoulders are bothering you during the movement, consider experimenting with a wider grip or utilizing some of the vertical pressing progressions listed on the site.

Slowly raise the dumbbells to around shoulder height. Pause and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.",
    "tip_1": "Focus on keeping the reps slow and controlled. Because this is an isolation exercise, the focus should be on correctly working the muscle - not moving as much weight as possible. Don't bring your arms up too high - up to shoulder height is far enough. If you encounter pain in the shoulder while performing the movement, consider implementing one of the following tweaks: Tilt your pinkies slightly higher than your thumbs. Imagine you’re pouring out a cup of water. Turn your palms forward so that your thumbs are pointing away from your body. This will put the shoulder in a more externally rotated position and potentially open up the shoulder joint to allow for a bit more movement.",

Utilizing a Smith machine will ensure the bar path remains in a fixed position, eliminating some of the need to stabilize during the exercise. It's also a viable option for moving heavy weight without a spotter. The overhead press is a foundational movement for establishing baseline strength and building a completely balanced physique. The exercise can be included in shoulder workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",

Position your hands around shoulder-width apart and unrack the bar using a pronated grip. This is the starting position for the movement. Press the bar overhead by extending the elbows and contracting the deltoids. Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position (the arms should be roughly 90 degrees or slightly lower depending on limb lengths). Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",

Move the shoulder within the joint, not the shoulder blade on the ribcage. Keep the abs braced and don’t arch the back at the top of the movement. Hinge as far as comfortably possible while completing the exercise. Or, you could also take a seated position to complete the exercise as well. If you experience shoulder pain during the movement then it may be beneficial to rotate the dumbbells until the thumbs are pointing away from one another and the palms are facing forward. This is also known as a supinated grip and will externally rotate the shoulder. Don’t jut your head forward during the movement - this is about stimulation for a small muscle group.

When the bar has reached its peak, reverse the movement slowly while controlling the bar back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tip_1": "Don’t lean back as you pull the weight up, keep the motion under control and don’t rely on momentum. This exercise may be contraindicated for some folks as they have a higher chance of impingement during the movement due to anatomical factors, shoulder mobility, and hand positioning. If you can, limit elbow movement to chest height to decrease the chance of potential shoulder impingement. If upright rows bother your wrists, consider a dumbbell, cable, or banded options as these place less stress on the wrists. As you drive the elbows high, ensure the head doesn’t jut forward.",

Many lifters utilize the dumbbell reverse fly to target the rear delts, an often lagging muscle for many lifters alike. Strengthening the rear delts by performing a rear delt fly can lead to improved posture and a greater level of strength on other lifts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Set up for the exercise by setting an adjustable back bench to an angle of around 30-40 degrees.

Take a deep breath then press the dumbbells overhead by extending the elbows and contracting the deltoids.

Keeping the elbows slightly bent at the top and not locking out entirely will help to keep tension on the shoulders.

Utilizing the cable pulley machine is useful in that it provides constant tension on the target muscle group as you move the weight through the range of motion. The exercise targets the front deltoid, which does get a significant amount of work in your pressing movements. That said, working on your front deltoids can lead to a fuller shoulder look and broader upper body.",
    "instructions_raw": "Assume a shoulder width stance with the cable running between your legs and grasp the handle with both hands using a pronated grip. Inhale, brace your abs, and raise the arms vertically while keeping the elbows slightly bent. Once the arms are parallel with the floor, slowly lower the handle back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Don’t lean back as you raise the arms, keep the motion under control and don’t rely on momentum. If you experience pain at the shoulder while performing the movement, use a neutral grip and keep your thumb pointing at the ceiling. Try not to bounce at the top of the movement, allow the shoulders to flex and then lower slowly.",

The use of kettlebells, as seen in the kettlebell lateral raise, provides a unique challenge in the form of an alternative implement. In the case of kettlebells, the weight is below the handles forcing your muscles to fight gravity to stabilize the weight.",

    "tips_raw": "If you want to keep more tension through the side delts, don’t allow the weights to touch your sides and control the eccentric (lowering) portion of the movement. Keep the abs braced and don’t lean back or arch your back at the top of the movement. Allow the shoulders to move freely but don’t completely lock out the elbows. Leaning forward may help to enhance rear delt activation. Don’t allow the kettlebells to collide in the bottom of the movement as this may present a potential injury risk.",

    "tips_raw": "Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spending too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will very wide. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell. If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",

    "tips_raw": "Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spending too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will very wide. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell. If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",

    "overview": "The sumo stance high pull is a variation of the high pull and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the shoulders and traps. The sumo high pull is somewhat of a combination exercise (combining a sumo deadlift with an upright row) and will target other muscles groups such as the upper back and hamstrings. High pulls are performed explosively, and since the traps respond well to explosive movements, will help with trap muscle growth. They also have a significant amount of application in sports-specific training where explosiveness is an important indicator for performance.",
    "instructions_raw": "Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length). Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor. Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip. Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”. As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar. Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away. As the bar nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms. The bar should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement. As the bar returns back to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward. Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Stance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates. The sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible. To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”. The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats. Ideally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint. You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly. Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider: If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics. Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift. Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you. Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion. Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar. Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend. If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.",

    "overview": "The dumbbell floor press is a variation of the floor press and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the triceps and chest. Primarily, the dumbbell floor press will target the muscles of the triceps. The limited range of motion effectively takes the chest somewhat out of the equation of the press. However, the chest can still be indirectly targeted when using the floor press. Simply focus on squeezing the pecs at the top of the movement. Floor presses, in generally, are particular helpful for those looking to build stronger triceps to help with locking out more compound press variations. They can also be beneficial for bodybuilders trying to add mass to their triceps.",
    "instructions_raw": "Begin sitting on the floor in an upright position with your legs straight and the dumbbells vertically balanced on the floor. Pick up each dumbbell and set it high in your hip crease while maintaining a tight grip. Slowly lay back while keeping the dumbbells close to your chest and bend your knees to roughly 45 degrees and move your feet up slightly. Press the weights to full extension by contracting your triceps and chest. Slowly lower the weight until both elbows touch the floor then press both dumbbells back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. To complete the exercise, simply lower the weights to the ground in “controlled drop” fashion. It should be a smooth motion but not one requiring excessive effort or one that puts the shoulder under unnecessary risk.",
    "tips_raw": "Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely. Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle in order to keep the elbows in a neutral position. Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself. Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Don’t bounce the elbows off the floor at the bottom of the rep. Doing so may result in injury due to the compressive forces being generated between the weight and the floor. Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to excessive arch.",

The close grip bench press is a superior movement when we’re talking about exercises that will pack mass onto your triceps. That said, use of close grips can provide some shoulder and elbow discomfort for some. This exercise can be included in your tricep workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Lie flat on a bench and set your hands at shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. The elbows will be tucked more than a normal bench due to the decrease grip width but if you experience shoulder pain during this variation you may have to slightly tweak grip width and elbow tuck to provide more space within the shoulder capsule. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.",

Adding weight to a dip belt is an excellent way to progress from the bodyweight variation of the tricep dip and will ensure you are continuously getting stronger and building muscle from performing the lift. Weighted tricep dips can be added in your arm workouts, upper body workouts, push workouts, or full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Step up onto the dip station (if possible) and position your hands with a neutral grip. Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor. Control the descent to parallel and then drive back to the starting position by pushing through the palms. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Technically there are two ways to perform dips - neither is wrong, just different movement with different purposes: Staying upright and keeping the elbows in close to increase tricep recruitment. Leaning forward with elbows wider to increase chest recruitment. If possible, keep the legs straight down while bracing the glutes and abs to limit excessive spinal movement. If no dip station with steps is available, position a box underneath the handles to boost yourself up to the bars. If no box is available, then jump into position. Don’t allow the head to jut forward during the descent. Ensure the elbows stay just short of lockout to keep tension on the triceps. Experiment with a false grip by wrapping the thumb over the bar as this may be more comfortable for some.",

    "instruction_step_1": "The close grip push up is a variation of the push up that focuses on hitting the triceps. Set up by placing your palms on the floor with your thumbs touching one another. Extend your legs back so that only your toes are touching the floor and your body is straight. Bend slightly at the elbows to keep tension in your triceps. Keeping your body straight, slowly lower yourself as far as possible without hitting the floor. Pause, and then push back up to the starting position without locking your elbows out. Repeat for desired reps.",
    "tip_1": "Keep your elbows tucked in at your side throughout the set. Don't lock your elbows out. This takes the tension off the triceps and makes the exercise less effective. The close-grip push-up is a good finishing exercise or as a second exercise in a superset.",

Well-built triceps also have a lot of positive carryover into your pressing movements such as bench press variations and shoulder press variations. The V-bar tricep extension can be included in your tricep workouts, upper body workouts, push workouts, and full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Attach a v-bar to a cable stack as high as possible and assume a standing position. Grasp the v-bar with a semi pronated grip (palms slightly facing) and lean forward slightly by hinging at the hips. Initiate the movement by extending the elbows and flexing the triceps. Pull the handle downward until the elbows are almost locked out and then slowly lower under control back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",

Imagine there’s a screw running through your elbow and don’t allow them to move in front of the body as you extend at the bottom of the movement. Experiment with static elbow positioning throughout the lift - some may find that they get a better stretch in the bottom portion of the movement by allowing their elbows to drift behind the body during the eccentric portion of the movement (similar to a drag curl).

The movement will also indirectly target the muscles of the chest and shoulders. The close grip bench press is a superior movement when we’re talking about exercises that will pack mass onto your triceps. That said, use of close grips can provide some shoulder and elbow discomfort for some. This exercise can be included in your tricep workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",
    "instructions_raw": "Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands at shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.",

The one arm kettlebell floor press provides all sorts of unique challenges for the triceps and core. The unilateral nature of the exercise forces one to use their core to stabilize their body as they move the weight. The unique thing about kettlebells is the weight lies lower than the handle you hold. This forces you to battle gravity more so than using a dumbbell, where the weight is in line with the handle.",
    "instructions_raw": "Begin in a side lying position with the kettlebell next your body. Grasp the handle with both hands and slowly roll onto your back. Once you are laying flat on the floor, bend your knees to roughly 45 degrees and slide your heels towards your butt. Slowly lower the weight until your elbow touches the floor then press to full extension by contracting your triceps and chest. Lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
    "tips_raw": "To sit back up, use your free hand to support the kettlebell as you lower it to the ground or sit up. Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely. Squeeze the kettlebell handle as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability. Don’t bounce the elbows off the floor at the bottom of the rep. Doing so may result in injury due to the compressive forces being generated between the weight and the floor.
